I am currently working with multiple Amazon Review Datasets, and applying text preprocessing, mining, and
techniques such as Topic Modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to analyze the customers’
reviews and the important features. The aim is to build a model to find the relation between reviews and
the associated ‘Helpful Votes’ count, along with other attributes.
