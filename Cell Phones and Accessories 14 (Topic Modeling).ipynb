       " \"the last year or so we have all seen an explosion of nice color phones in the market  most of their functionalities are the similar while some have the extra bonus bells and whistles while really sells the product  like many others i was attracted to this phone because of the nice styling the size and the camera  i have previously owned a samsung s105 which was a nice phone as well so it was easy for me to learn this phone since many menu functions were similar\\nthe first and foremost thing i look for in a phone is the sound quality  the sound quality of the phone is not bad  having owned the nokia 6610 as well i would say the nokia phone sounds a little better but this might be because i am used to the 6610  i am sure most people will be happy with the sound quality of the e715\\nthe next thing is reception  unlike the older samsung phones this phone uses an internal antenna which works good if not better than phones with antennas\\nthe camera on this phone is quite nice  there is a flash and a zoom feature which is added bonus  the 640x480 pictures taken by this phone is ok to be viewed by cell phones' smaller screens but if you view the pictures on your computer you might be disappointed\\nthis phone does have a 40 chord midi capability which means you can download some good songs  for the tech savvy there is a program called easy gprs which can be downloaded from samsung's european website this program will allow you sync up your phone with your pc  the other program which i like is called psm play which allows you to edit midi files and convert them into mmf files\\none useful feature which this phone does not have is speaker phone  generally i don't like to hold the phone next to my ear or use the ear pieces  the speaker phone on the nokia is great for this purpose\\nanother minor inconvinence with this phone is the phone's irda capability with your pc  as i have mentioned already you will need to download an application from samsung europe in order to transfer data from your pc to your phone  with some other phones such as the sony ericcson t610 you can simply transfer files through window's default program when you match your phone's infra red port with your laptop's  of course easygprs also have the ability to do many other things but sometimes i wish that i can transfer simple images/sounds directly using just windows\\nfinally the battery on this phone runs out a little faster than some other phones  if you play around with this phone often the battery will run out in a day  if you don't it will last 2-3 days\\ncurrently this is not the best cell phone on the market but this is definitely one of the best tmobile gsm phones at the moment  with rebates this phone will only cost $50 which is well worth the price of cancelling your old account and starting up a new one\",\n",

       " 'one great thing about the cell phone industry in this country is that your contract expires in one year  this means that every year you can get a new phone often at a great subisidized price if you choose to select a \"new\" contract  you might need to give up your old numbers (unless you are switching betwewen the carriers) but for those who don\\'t care it\\'s a great way to try out lots of new phones at very little cost  keep this tip in mind when you are buying this phone\\n\\nto get the good news out first one thing great about verizon phones is that they all have great reception  this more likely is due to verizon installing more cell phone antennas everywhere than the phones themselves but to the end user it\\'s all the same  as a travelling consultant reception is the single most important aspect to look for in a phone  when i am out in rural areas and a client wishes to speak to me it\\'s imperative that i am able to talk to the client without interruptions or static  this is the part which this phone and verizon excels at\\n\\nsadly the v710 does not excel in anything else compared to its peers  as other posters have complained the bluetooth functionality is limited because verizon decided to disable file transfer capabilities  that way verizon can force the users to download ringtones and other goodies instead of people copying files from their computers via bluetooth  the way to get around this is to get the 128mb transflash card which i did buy  this worked out great as i was able to transfer songs and music from my computer to the phone with no problems\\n\\nsome other useful (if not standard) features in this phone include a standard 1 megapixel camera (4x zoom) a video capture (which allows you to capture 15 sec clips with full sound whoopie) speaker phone (a very nice feature which is missing from samsung phones) and voice dialing (good feature if you drive and talk a lot something which i find to be extremely annoying when others do it)\\n\\nnow onto the ugly part  motorolla continues to implement the annoying loud beep when the phone is low on batteries  i don\\'t know how to turn this off and embarassed myself over at a client\\'s site because of this  this is also one of the very few phones which does not come with a headset (samsung nokia even the sidekick ii packages give you this for free)  even if you do get the headset it comes with only 1 earbud so you cannot get stereo quality sounds which the mp3 should be able to give off\\n\\nin summary if you are a casual user and reception is very important to you then get this phone or at the very least go for verizon phones  if you are looking for features (which are actually implemented well) to show off to friends then you should probably go for the motorola razor from sprint or maybe a samsung or sonyericson  if you are looking for phone to do text messaging (especially aim) and web browsing then be sure to get the sidekickii  if you want a business phone for outlook sync and messaging then go for one of the blackberry phones\\n\\nupdate: i just found that there are in fact stereo headsets for this phone it\\'s just that amazon does not carry them  from howardforums (the hardcore phone mod community) people are also complaining about the v710\\'s new firmware which disables audio transfers from the transflash card onto the phone  yes verizon wants to make that extra buck from ringtones that badly  the upside to the new firmware is that the camera quality is better and the bluetooth is finally working with some cars',\n",

       " \"i have been itching for a treo ever since the 600 came out and i noticed that more streamlined design  when smartphones were first introduced i bucked the trend of combining the two thinking that as often as i use my cell phone and my pda if i bought one that integrated both i would wear it out twice as fast  and in my humble opinion it was a valid reason because back then the original phone/pda's were impossibly large  well i have finally become a convert\\n\\ni spent a great deal of time researching blackberry's vs the treo's vs pocket pc's and came very close to grabbing a t-mobile dash (which i still believe is the all-around smallest model availabe as i write this or at least it seemed to be) but i finally settled with the trusted palm os platform (one that i have become very familiar with over the years using pda's for quite some time now)  when i set out to get one i really had my heart set on the treo 680but as i read the reviews for them one thing kept creeping in to almost all the reviews: battery life was terrible  with that aside quite a few of the reviewers mentioned that all things considered they were more happy with their old 650  i saw this on so many reviews that i began to think twice  then i noticed that the 700p was a more beefed up version of the 650 and began to consider it as well  unfortunately as i write this it isn't available with alltell service where i am (it will but nobody can give me a target date and dang it i am too impatient to wait) so i am right back with the 650  it took a while before palm was able to knock enough of the bugs out of the 650 that i felt like buying one would be worth itand i am discovering more than a few bugs have been associated with both the 680 & 700p so no matter how much time i spend considering upgrading to a newer model i find compelling reasons to go right back to the old school 650\\n\\nreason #1 to go with it: since it is no longer available at palm's official website and with the newer models coming out chances are you can find some pretty sweet deals on the older 650\\nreason #2: virtually all of the problems originally associated with the 650 have been eliminated  you want push email  you can get it  you want web surfing  no prob  you want to view and edit ms word documents and excell  easier than ever with the 650 (that was one major plus over most of the pocket pc's and all of the blackberrys -- sure you can view some of these documents but you cannot edit them too)\\nreason #3: no matter how convenient the pda i found it next to impossible to give up a touch-screen's amazing versatility and the ease with which you can use it to edit things and connect on websites\\n\\none more important item to factor in when considering buying a 650: with the popularity with ever increasing wireless downloading speeds i was afraid that the slower treo would make internet surfing next to impossible because of the archaic speeds with which you are forced to endure  i was very pleastantly surprised that downloading web pages did not take as long as i was at first expecting  i have to tell you after experimenting with the supposedly much faster 700p with another online carrier than the one i was using (i won't say which but they really did their best to tell me the 650 was slower than a dial-up modem from 1985) anyway the 650 was only slightly slower than this screaming fast 700p or the 700w  i figured that was something i could live with to be honest  hey it's a tiny hand-held device that allows me to send and receive email and surf the webi'm still amazed that something like this exists at all to be honest with youso downloading speed is still secondary in my opinion  if speed really is on your list of absolutes maybe you ought to move up to something elsebut keep in mind it is only barely faster than what i experienced first hand\\n\\none more thing: the screen is amazing  there are only so many ways to say wow  if you are considering buying a palm that runs windows mobile you ought to know that the screen clarity is almost reduced by half  this apparently has something to do with window's os and seriously put my decision to buy one on the back burner\\n\\nsure there are things that a smartphone cannot as yet do without some difficulty or impossibilitybut that is the same with all current models  do some serious research into what you want vs what you need and make an informed decision only after you have had the chance to go into a store and test a specific model personally  do that and no matter what you decide on you will most likely be happy  so far i know i am very satisfied with my choice  good luck on yours\\n\\n***update***\\n\\ni opted not to get a bluetooth hands-free device -- at first  originally i would see people walking around with these lt uhura type thingy's sticking out of their ears and i couldn't help but wonder how lazy people are that they cannot raise their hand up to their head while walking around simply to talk on the phone  for the most part i still feel this way but i decided to buy a bluetooth hands-free headset for while i am driving  i cannot afford to miss calls and being in radio when not at work or home i can be found in my car monitoring the radio virtually 100% of the time and unfortunately this means i sometimes cannot hear the ringer  the tethered device that came with the phone is certainly loud enough but simply did not fit my ear (it kept falling out)  i bought a replacement that came with a variable size adapter and yet while it fit better the sound was almost impossible to hear (the worst i have ever experienced actually)  so i took the plunge knowing full-well that the palm treo has a somewhat problematic history using these devicesso i made sure that i had an iron-clad return policy in place and jumped in  it took me no more than a minute to configure my head-set and i went ahead and made a test call which had more than enough volume -- in fact it had plenty to spare  all in all i am very satisfied with the performance (i bought a keycera bluetooth if that means anything)\\n\\none additional item that requires mentioning: i currently have call-waiting as a service with my treo and yet i have missed at least 3 calls (that i know of)  this particular feature does not seem to be supported by the 650and if it is i have yet to discover any useful info regarding the problem whether online or in the bible-sized instruction manual  i will keep looking and if i find a solution i will quickly report it here asap  just one more thing to think about  otherwise i am amazingly satisfied with my treo otherwise  the only thing i wish (other than user-friendly call-waiting) is faster downloads while online  that is supposedly possible with the newer models using evdo and yet the 700p i tested failed to work only slightly faster than my 650  maybe it was the network -- but not according to them (no surprise there)  i still think my purchase was well worth it\",\n",
       " 'as someone who used the original palm pilot and eventually the handspring visor with visor phone i thought off and on about buying the treo 650 the very mixed sometimes extreme reviews of the 650 and the relatively high price for an unlocked treo kept me away with the release of the next generation of treos drmatically forcing down the price of the 650 i decided to take a chance after a week of fairly active use i have to say that i am extremely pleased with my new treo i bought my new unlocked (cingular branded) treo online the phone clarity is as good as any mobile phone that i have owned i have not had any dropped calls the browswer and e-mail client that came loaded on my treo work well i live in a country where the fastest mobile data connection is still gprs/edge so my tro 650 is just right i easily synced my treo with my macbook with no problems over all for $225 + shipping and handling of $20 i have to say that this was a real bargain',\n",

       " 'i have owned a treo 650 on and off and on again since this model came out  initially i was extremely frustrated by the phone\\'s telephone performance and its lack of stability  frequent reboots freezes and dropped calls made it difficult to appreciate the phone  i ended up getting rid of it and relying on a separate palm and cell phone  over time palmone has released firmware updates (the phone\\'s operating system) that have made the phone very stable  the improvements we so significant that they actually won me back  this review is for the gsm treo 650\\n\\na word about carriers: i only use gsm because i travel abroad frequently - this limits me to cingular and tmobile  i have used both and i have found that cingular\\'s network coverage is more complete especially in rural areas but tmobile\\'s network sounds better  it\\'s a tradeoff - with tmobile you\\'ll drop the call more often but with cingular you\\'ll say \"what\" more often  their coverage is about equal in big cities and along major highways  international roaming is less expensive with tmobile plus cingular has a few hurdles in place that prevent you from enabling international roaming on your account if you\\'ve been with them for less than 6 months  verizon and sprint use a cellular technology that is us-only and therefore no good for using your phone abroad\\n\\nhere are the phone\\'s pros: in your pocket you have your address book datebook notes e-mail low-res still and video camera a very nice sms interface that threads sms exchanges by contact a web browser and an mp3 player  the qwerty keyboard makes typing much faster than a standard phone  the interface is unique and you will need a little time to get used to it but once you do you will be as efficient at quick-dialing and keeping up with daily use as on any other phone  also this phone is a quad-band gsm which means that it will work very well abroad unlike the more common tri-band gsm phones which don\\'t perform as well  (remember if you get a treo smartphone from verizon or sprint it will not work abroad)  the screen on the palm version is brilliant  the windows version is not as sharp - a limitation imposed by the operating system  also gsm technology uses \"sim\" cards which means you can simply change out the \"sim\" and use your phone on another network or another phone number either domestically or while abroad  (you might have a phone locked onto a carrier\\'s network until your contract commitment is complete but that\\'s something you can sort out on your own)\\n\\nhere are the phone\\'s cons: i said \"in your pocket\" because if you mount this thing on your belt the bulge may force you to make alterations on your sport jacket  also in an age of identity theft and information security you should think long and hard about just how much information is in there  believe me the phone quickly becomes a place to store passwords account information customer information etc  consider how you will feel if you leave it in a restaurant or if it\\'s stolen\\n\\nhere are lesser cons that can be worked around: the beauty of these palm phones is that they\\'re so popular; other people have had whatever problem you might encounter and they\\'ve written software to address / fix / work around the issue  for example i found that the phone\\'s volume is not loud enough  there is 3rd party volume software to fix that as well as software that allows you to use the phone as a bluetooth modem for your computer  some software is freeware some is shareware and some is for purchase  the key is that there are so many forums and resources on the internet that you can search around and find the answers that you need and the phone allows you to install and uninstall with as much ease as with your home pc\\n\\nthoughts about newer treo phones:  the 650 now costs a little less because the treo 700w and 700p have come out  this is a good thing because i don\\'t see the 700 having any new features that make the upgrade a \"must\"  other than a slightly redesigned appearance and interface and higher resolution camera the phone\\'s features are basically identical  also as of the summer 2006 the treo 700 is only available on cdma networks  the treo folks have staggered the release of gsm and cdma models to give the all carriers a turn at exclusivity\\n\\nlooking to the future there is speculation that the next generation treo phone will be a gsm it will be thinner lighter and the antenna will be internal - basically it will more resemble a blackberry on the outside  these are much sought after features by treo users  maybe i\\'ll upgrade then\\n\\nin conclusion only 4 stars for this phone because the product wasn\\'t ready for market when they released it  it\\'s much better now; if they had initially released the current product i would have given it 5 stars  i hope my perspective helps you with your decision\\n\\nupdate - jan 08 2007: the treo750 (windows mobile) has come out in the uk with vodafone and here in the usa the treo680 (palm os) has been announced with cingular  in forums on the internet people have reported that the new 680 addresses many wish-list items for the treo faithful: slighly thinner (a modest few millimeters) internal antenna better keyboard volume-too-low issue \"sort of\" resolved better mp3 player (ptunes instead of real) more memory improved phone interface edge instead of gprs to double the data speed  unfortunately the camera has the same resolution (640x480) and the few millimeters thinner have meant a thinner battery  treo 680 owners complain of poor battery life (1 day or significantly less for power users)\\n\\nas of thanksgiving every vendor pre-selling the treo 680 was sold out (including amazon)  this tells me two things: many treo users are looking to upgrade immediately by choice not out of necessity  as a result the market should be flooded with inexpensive used treo650s and no doubt merchants with 650 inventory will probably sell them inexpensively enough for people who have been priced out of the smartphone market to get their hands on one\\n\\npalm says the 680 is targeted to the every day person not the power user  i suppose that means in a year we should expect another more expensive model that will be what the 680 should have been  i feel that palm is releasing new models in a very slow and calculated manner in order to drive consumer spending\\n\\nmy recommendation: if you want a treo go with the 650  with an extended battery a power user (bluetooth e-mail etc) can go 2 days between charges or 3 days with normal usage  look for it online\\n\\nthe smartphone market has become very crowded with the slim motorola q (windows) the comparably sized and feature-rich nokia e61 (legendary stability of symbian os) friendlier and proven blackberry models the samsung blackjack (windows) and lately the mda (windows) is getting rave reviews with all the features you wish you could have including wi-fi\\n\\nthe treo does a lot - it probably has the best sms interface on the market but the rest is just ok  for example the mp3 player works but not as good as a dedicated mp3 player like an iriver or ipod  the e-mail application works but the imap implementation is poor and pop3 performance is inconsistent re: leaving or deleting messages from the server  if you want a good e-mail application on the treo you\\'ll have to buy a 3rd party program that will be almost as good as the blackberry  but you will have to buy this app and the more 3rd party apps you load the less stable the device  what i\\'m saying is the treo is a jack of many trades but it\\'s a master of none (except sms/mms messaging)  while i am a palm faithful i\\'m afraid that if you want a *stable* phone e-mail address book and schedule the blackberry is the way to go but you won\\'t have the bells and whistles (camera mp3 player 3rd party apps and touch screen) that come with a treo  yes that means i now have a crackberry  it was a xmas gift from a friend who was tired of hearing me complain about my treo  here is the bottom line: if you\\'re getting this device as a business tool where missed calls or e-mails translate to lost money get a blackberry  if you want a really cool phone with all the bells and whistles you can fathom and you like loading 3rd party applications and you like having a fun device to play with then you will absolutely love the treo',\n",

       " \"i'm in the pro-v188 camp  i think it's a solid good-quality cell phone  the color screen is a bit small compared to more expensive phones but hey you get this for free before the generous rebate so stop bitching about this not being a high-end phone for it's not meant to be a high-end phone  it has good reception and voice quality and is built rather like a tank: solid durable a little on the thick side  if you want something stylish go with a razr or pebl or slvr  if you want something small and lasts forever go with a sanyo pcs phone for sprint  but the v188 is a good basic phone no doubt about that\",\n",
       " 'i had been very happy with my motorola phone until the battery started losing its charge within a day even when the phone was turned off the friendly but incompetent customer support kept me on the phone for an average of 40 minutes for the repeated calls trying to figure out the problem after the phone had finally been sent to their technical service center they returned it to me that the phone was irreperable \"due to customer abuse\" i have done nothing to that phone that could have caused any damage (unless using it to make phone calls counts as \"customer abuse\") but got the same comment without explanation after i had sent the phone in for a second time for reevaluation it seems that motorola is just trying to get out of fixing or replacing the phone free of charge under warranty you\\'ll be fine with a motorola phone as long as it works after that you\\'re on your own',\n",

you don\\'t buy a phone for its games but just to show how lacking t-mobile\\'s support isthe razr includes a demo for bejeweled after the (very) short demo is over it asks if you want to buy it clicking the link brings you to a webpage that says \"sorry we don\\'t offer games for your phone yet\" my wife\\'s v330 has a similar issue she\\'s had it for over 4 months and services like t-mobile still offer no games for the phone again i know you shouldn\\'t buy a phone based on the number of games offered for it but its still a feature something to whittle away the time while waiting at the dmv\\n\\n5) camera phone still only 640x480 decent pics at that resolution but given that there are cheaper phones on the market (i didn\\'t get this phone for free) with higher pixel values this is a moderate oversight on moto\\'s part\\n\\n6) phone response is fairly poor as well example - going through my contacts by pressing keys (going from q to r to s)so very slow you think the phone hasn\\'t responded so you mash the button again at which point it responds to two button presses and you have to start all over again\\n\\n7) the phone tools application is a little user unfriendly and totally geared to people who mess around with outlook csvs on a daily basis i\\'ve managed to get it to work but not without some work\\n\\nalright so now for the good\\n\\n1) this phone is a veritable conversation piece oohs and ahhs all aroundif you care about that sort of thing i usually don\\'t i just want a functional phone that gets good battery life gets a decent signal and can withstand a beating (i\\'m a klutz) but if you do care about the conversation-worthyness of your cell phone this one has it in spades\\n\\n2) great battery power i\\'ve had it on for 5 days at moderate usage and i\\'ve still got 2 bars left\\n\\n3) this is a sturdy phone my kid has already dropped it on cement twice and i\\'ve seen no scratches at all maybe i\\'m lucky as another reviewer mentioned that poor build quality on his piece i\\'ve not had any issues the phone is rock solid\\n\\n4) the usual amount of ringtones and wallpapersall of which are amazingly expensive why does it cost 2 bucks for a hi-fi ringtone lasting 20 seconds when i can buy the song at itunes for a dollar\\n\\n5) the phonetools software allows you to create your own ringtones i haven\\'t played around with the software yet so i\\'m going to guess that your abilities to import mp3s or cd-audio will be truncated to some degree\\n\\n6) excellent bluetooth performance haven\\'t had the opportunity to test file transfers and such but the razr\\'s connection to my moto bt headset is great doesn\\'t matter which side of my body they are situated decent sound quality even at 20 feet of unobstructed space\\n\\n7) did i mention this phone is attractve\\n\\n8) ringtones can get quite loud even without degrading ringtone sound quality i wish the speaker was this loud\\n\\nthis phone has some serious shortcomings - most important among them is the poor performance of the phonebook app poor signal quality and low speaker volume ordinarily i\\'d be bringing the phone back like tomorrow but the design of the phone and its excellent bt performance makes me want to hang onto it\\n\\nhopefully moto learns from their mistakes and releases a razr v4 with better earpiece volume and snappier response times',\n",

       " \"i've owned virtually every treo since handspring sold the ingenious device to palm and unfortunately the company and its executives have done nothing but milk every dollar they can for their bonuses and kill the franchise in the process i really wanted to like this phone and tried every workaround unfortunately it goes back later today for many of the reasons alfredo gomez refers to other than a reasonably good form factor and hardware - which other companies have now caught up - palm has made very few changes do not believe most magazine reviews -- they are half done hack jobs by people who barely use the phone and write up their experience on specs and a day of usage it's not the normal experience and i will explain\\n\\n1) just not enough ram -\\n\\nif you are in any way using this phone as anything more than just pulling an email account and occasional surfing this phone is not for you in addition to microsoft themselves recommending 64mb of ram and the fact that every pda and phone for the past year and a half has at least 64 mb of ram palm foolishly decided to go with half that number -- the same 32 mb of ram that was available to users in their treo 600 released in 2002 this was greed with windows mobile this even more of a problem because it was built to multitask -- keep your applications open in the background and called to the front on request opening and closing bulky applications is slow in windows mobile with the 700w you get about 14mb of ram to run applications before you put in the necessary minimal add ons which will reduce your memory by at least 1-2 mb but the real problem are memory leaks in wm 5 which will reduce that number even more add the fact that the 700w will quit applications when you get to the 5mb level this will mean that your device will not multitask and you might have 2 apps open at the same time maybe even 3 if they are not memory intensive if you have open your email program and may have surfed using pocket ie recently then opening your contact manager like pocketinformant will take you at least 5-10 seconds you will hate that rotating colored ball this cannot be changed as there are no ram upgrades i need to reset the phone at least once a day to clear the ram\\n\\n2) sms and email problems: if you will use sms or email frequently this phone can make you pull your hair out there is a bug (feature) in sms and pocketoutlook where scrolling down means the cursor goes to the bottom of the page view thus if you have a 14 line email or document you are editing the only way to get to line 5 is to whip out that stylus or scrolling a few hundred characters to the right until you get there unfortunately the same goes for sms which is not threaded this means that you can't see the ongoing conversation you may have with different people it is by date end of story there aren't any suitable alternatives right now unfortunately nothing for sms and the best email program i have seen is web is flexmail which itself requires several keypresses just to delete an email -- unless once again you want to whip out that stylus one handed operation is better than other wm devices but not even close to the ease of using the palm os\\n\\n3 240x240 screen is barely adequate if you use the web and infuriating with the limited number of apps that work with the 700w on a whole it's better than i thought and not really a problem for most apps that use this resolution reading ebooks is a tad fuzzy but perfectly acceptable even at smaller fonts but squeeze that ie page into your tiny screen and the little fonts will be illegible want to view a power point for example a word doc you received in email with a 240x320 you see just enough to view a whole page and make it out not so with 240x240 it's just a little too coarse and you have to zoom everything it's also a lot of info to cram into that tiny screen\\n\\n3) windows mobile has advantages and nice things about it but it is still not an optimal os for mobile use it is amazing that many tasks still require you to use a stylus or take an absurd number of keypresses for example if you want to simply save a number in your phone log you can just navigate and save you must pull out the stylus point and hold and wait for save as to appear sure this isn't horrific but it becomes very noticeable when you do this regularly if you ever used a palm os phone you will wish you could go back knowing palm they will not improve the system in time and in a year or two microsoft will finally get this right\\n\\nwifi is ok but very weak and almost useless with the external card bluetooth is adequate\\n\\non the pros the battery life is reasonably good form factor is ok and the build quality is better than other phones like the xv6700 the screen clarity and contrast is also very good as a phone it is acceptable\\n\\nso the end result is that unless you are a basic user that only wants to check an email account doesn't get a lot of email doesn't use sms much doesn't really use the pda much then this phone is not a solution for you it will be nice to experience for the first 2 weeks and then you will begin to see the problems tear you apart soon after becoming familiar with the phone it is sad that virtually all of these problems can be traced to palm executives greed on trying to milk out just one more sale from an old phone that had a form factor that was the best for a long time at this day and age consumers have a choice and need for more than just a phone that feels good in your hand don't be stupid if microsoft recommends that any application they provide needs 64 mb of ram there is nobody stupid enough to even try to run it with less that is the palm treo 700w\",\n",

       " 'i\\'ve had this phone for two months now and loooove it  i\\'ve wanted a slider for a while saw the t809 researched it and got it to replace my beloved motorola v-300 which after three years was startin\\' to act up  the keys are flat and small and takes some gettin\\' used to  at 1st i thought i\\'d have to remove the phone from its case and slide open i wanted to do anythingand that got tired real fast  fortunately this is not the case you can answer the phone just by hitting the \"dial/menu confirm\" key on the outside of the phone  to end the call just hit the \"power on/off/menu exit\" key you can go to slider options and program it so that it\\'s convenient for you  you can use the slider to answer and end calls or you can have the slider have no effect what so ever on calls  you can do the same stuff with the slider down as you can with the slider up/open  difference is it\\'s much quicker with the slider open as you can use shortcuts  when you close the slider you\\'ll have the option to \"lock\" it or not  to unlock just hit the left and right soft keys in that order  soon you\\'ll be doin\\' it without any thought there\\'s a volume key on the side of the phone  the volume\\'s pretty loud both on and off speaker  sometimes i even have to turn the phone volume down cos the caller comes through too loud  another thing about the sound with my v-300 i could barely hear my mp3 ringtones  not so with the t809  you can also adjust how you want your silent alert (vibrate or mute) to put t809 on silent just press and hold the # key  unlike my motorola v-300 i don\\'t have to wait for the call to connect before i\\'m able to activate the speaker\\nthe camera\\'s 13 mega pixels but that ain\\'t the kicker  it\\'s what you can do with the pictures you take  you can edit an image with the following options: none (leaves you with a regular lookin\\' photo) black & white (self explanatory) negative (looks like a negative) sepia (classic lookin\\' brown tint) blur (self explanatory) sharp (se) sketch (looks like an artist sketched it with pencil) posterize (i can\\'t even explain this one  just gives it a slightly different look) & solarize (this really looks artsy)  there are even a variety of picture \"frames\" that you can use to decorate your photos\\nas for the video cam you can get a good 20-30 seconds of footage  speakin\\' of videos there\\'s  a music video on this phone  i just gotta find out how and where to get some more  lemme find out i could be watchin\\' duran duran on my cell phone whaaaaat  anywho i\\'m not interested in using it as an mp3 cos i have an mp3that i use as an mp3\\nalso i thought i could only get yahoo  silly me  i have several url favorites saved (yahoo msn bbc google mapquest superpages)  you can store up to 10 url\\'s  i check my yahoo and msn mail easily (but i can\\'t open attachments)  there seem to be more mp3 ringtones available to me with this phone  as for games i guess they\\'re updating constantly  pac-man wasn\\'t available when i first got the phone but it is now  i\\'m just waiting for my backgammon to be available on this phone  i also like that you can turn the calendar \"on\" and have it display on your wallpaper  turn it \"off\" and you just have your wallpaper photo  yes you can make your own photos your wallpaper too  yes you can have different ringtones and photos for each caller\\nokee doke i think i\\'ve taken up enough time  just wanted to leave my $002 end ended up writing the sequel to \"war & peace\"  hope this helps anyone considering gettin\\' the samsung t-809  :)\\n\\nupdate\\ni\\'ve had my t809 for over a year now and i\\'d just like to add a little somethin\\'\\nwhile with all of its bells and whistles the t809 is still very much wicked and relevant unfortunately after the first few months the battery life began to decline (okay nosedive is more like it) a few months ago i\\'d purchased a new battery and it has made no difference so it must be the phone itself i\\'m on the verge of purchasing a new phone as the battery life in my t809 only lasts about 4 hours on some days as a result i have to carry my charger everywhere and i couldn\\'t help but notice that t-mobile doesn\\'t even carry/offer this model anymore hmmm\\n\\ngreat phone but what good are the myriad of features if the darn thing won\\'t work when you need it i\\'m trying to hold out until there\\'s more feedback regarding the motorola rizr z3 that\\'s the next phone i\\'ve got my eye on i\\'ll miss samsung\\'s features and menu setup but this phone with its declining battery life has left me very weary of samsung',\n",

       " \"i received this phone from my brother (he used to work for nokia in texas) because my other phone broke (nokia 6102i) and my contract with cingular was for another year (yeah it sucks)\\n\\nbackground: i was not eligible for the upgrade yet so that meant i had to purchase a phone at retail price (without the contract) which would have run up upwards of $300 and more  so i got this phone (unlocked) as a gift and the switch-over was relatively easy and trouble-free  i copied my address book from the 6102i onto the sim card and when i moved the sim card to the 6126 the address book was there (taa-daa)  what i was not able to move were the photos i snapped with the old phone  those i had to send via email which i saved onto a microsd card and then was able to move to the 6126 (it has a microsd slot which read the 1gb card easily)\\n\\nfeatures:  i have always liked nokia this phone is no exception (except one which i will discuss later)  it is a clam (ie flip) phone and is almost as slim as (but slightly lighter than) my motorola razr i like the menu layout of the nokia the camera is up to 13 megapixel resolution (settings of 1024x1280 960x1290 600x800 480x640 240x320 and 120x160)  the photos are decent in daylight but not too great in poorly-lit areas (but that goes for every camera phone i've ever encountered)\\n\\ni like the black and silver coloring no external antenna (sweet) the button on the side to open it is extra (not necessary) the internal display is nice and large and colorful  i like the navigation keypad the textured covering on the rear flap is different (i like it and is about 50-50 with my friends)\\n\\nthere were plenty of hands-free features there's a speakerphone which is loud enough to be used outside bluetooth for connecting to a headset or for sending files as well as voice dialing and commands  there is pop3 and imap4 e-mail support audio messaging for sending voicemails directly to another cell phone and usb cable support (i haven't used this yet)\\n\\nthere is a large 1000-contact phone book has room in each entry for five phone numbers e-mail and web addresses a job title and a company name work and home street addresses a birth date etc the sim card can hold an additional 250 names  other extras include standard stuff: vibrate mode text and multimedia messaging calculator voice recorder a calendar with reminders notepad stopwatch and an alarm clock\\n\\nhands-free features were plentiful as well there's full bluetooth for connecting to a headset or for sending files plus voice dialing and commands and a speakerphone for hard-core emailers there is also pop3 and imap4 e-mail support\\n\\ni tested the quad-band gsm phone in san francisco/bay area using my existing cingular wireless service  i got the same quality as the old nokia 6102i phone  call quality was decent\\n\\nnow for the negatives  a minor drawback with the design is that the microsd card slot is located behind the battery cover  although you don't need to remove the battery itself but you do need to remove the cover my other beef is with the battery life  the 6126 has a rated talk time of 34 hours and a promised standby time of 10 days  when i maxed out the talk time i got about 35 to 375 hours talk-time (impressive)  because i am always on the phone it is hard to guage the standby time  however when i paired and activated the bluetooth and connected with a nokia bh-900 earpiece (by the way the bh-900 earpiece is sub-standard compared to the motorola hs850 but that is another review altogether) that is when i got a feeling about the battery life in standby  for half a day of minimal use (20 min max) and standby the rest of the day my battery is now at 20-25% capacity  when i turned off bluetooth i was able to go a full day with some use and still have over 50% battery capacity  so it seems that when the bluetooth feature is activated it is eating up more battery juice (which makes sense)  i have yet to find a control that tells the phone to automatically turn off bluetooth when there is no active device around\\n\\nconclusion:  the nokia 6126 is a nice phone with many features  i only gate it 4-stars because of the battery life  this is a must especially for a frequent traveler (like me) or those who use the phone/bluetooth earpiece a lot  nokia has to improve on the battery life and this is easily done with a patch to automatically turn off bluetooth when there are no bluetooth devices around\",\n",

       " 'this phone is good quality phone with good quality camera and video recorder  inserting or removing microsd card from under the battery cover is not a big deal  but there are three things i like to see moto improves it over the time:\\n\\n1) font size is small  due to high resolution screen the letters are small if you don\\'t have a 20 years or yonger eyes you may have problem to read the display;  hope moto will make the font size adjustable;\\n\\n2) moto phone tool software could not get the driver download  i spent a few hours on the phone with motorola support trying to get the krzr driver download so that the moto phone tool would work with this phone they say moto had released 43 phone tool software we spent many hours with motorola support engieers and mangers get the software updated to 435 but still no driver i can not sync the phone book into the phone motorola support engineers suggest to pay verizon $50 per month to enable the internet then sync the phone book over the internet instead of usb cable we are not ready to do that even with level 3 support engineers and support managers they can not provide a url to download krzr driver or email us the driver\\n\\n3)voice dialing needs improvement  i think the best way for setup voice dialing is in the phone book at each entry you should be able to tag each entry with a voice prompt so that you can use voice dialing easily  right now the voice dialing was trying to be smart by recongnizing your voice to english letters  so if you call \"bill smith\" you will need to speak clearly as \"bill smith\" if you want to say \"call billy\" it will not work  what if the name is not that easy to pronouce it will not work  when i only had one entry in the contact list the voice calling works like a charm --\"call home\" from the bluetooth headset automatcially called the number  when i has typed 10 contacts in the phone now the voice dial get confused and not dialing  i think moto needs to redesign this part so that user can use whatever the voice prompt for each phone book entry  half smart thing is the worst thing\\n\\nother than these i like this phone much better than others\\naug/1/2008 update:\\nafter using it over six months i had a few times the bluetooth function lock up the phone screen turn into bright white only way to get out that state is to take out the battery  not easy to do when you driving\\n\\nmy boy dropped the phone on the floor  phone landed on its back but front face glass shattered  still working but disappointed for the face glass broken by the shock to its back',\n",

       " 'i came to the n73 looking to flee the crashy performance of my t-mobile dash and it answered all my hopes and dreams the n73 is stable and rock solid but on occasion can be slow and every once in a while you\\'ll find yourself damning the espoo-dwellers who designed it for including a pop-port (instead of mini-usb) minisd (instead of microsd) no us 3g (yes the title says it has 3g but more on that later) and no wifi but let\\'s break it down (forewarning: i say t-mo dash but i\\'m using at&t yes i unlocked the dash don\\'t bother asking me about anything relating to t-mo)\\n\\nthe camera is awesome yes it\\'s only 32 mpixels and it\\'s low-light performance is ok (it gets a bit noisy but i\\'ve seen nikon\\'s with noisier pictures) the led flash is more useful than you think and the carl zeiss lenses are fantastic but what really steals the show is its auto-focus this means you\\'ll be able to make sure your pictures are in-focus and even macro focus\\'d (which can land you some decent but understated depth of field) on the bad side there\\'s no optical zoom (so you\\'ll never have real depth of field) the flash is good but it\\'s not godly there is no way at all to turn off the artificial shutter sound (so no incognito ever) the front facing camera is amazingly bad in low-light (you need sunlight for a clear picture) and no built-in geotagging (an app is available from nokia however) other than that it\\'s one of the best cameras i\\'ve ever used in a phone\\n\\nreception is godly i\\'ll get great reception in places where other phones scratch their heads just as a warning for everyone in the us: this phone does not have 3g you can use the original n73 (-1 -2 -3 and -4 models rm-133) has 3g using the 2100 mhz band which is only useful in europe the phone sold here the n73-5 (rm-132) has had this feature removed what this means: no 3g in the us and no 3g in europe either and before you bring up t-mobile\\'s use of the 2100 mhz band for their 3g network in the us: they use aws which requires the use of both a signal in the 2100 mhz band and the 1700 mhz band the n73-5 supports neither and the earlier n73s only support 2100 mhz no love there however by some magic of wonderfully optimized technology the edge radio in my n73 seems faster than that of my t-mo dash the web browser is faster sending e-mails seems faster hell i can even pull down internet radio and broadcast live on qik (though there are a lot of delays involved in the use of qik so if you\\'re buying the phone for that i suggest another phone)\\n\\ns60\\'s a great os but it\\'s got some flaws for one the e-mail client is downright simple and that\\'s bad no support for html messages (you\\'ll just see the tags) in-line images are a no-no there is no way to change the size of text (so everything is in big letters) and when you hit the send button you have to wait until the message is sent before you can pen another (well you can cancel but either way: you have to watch the progress bar when you send e-mail) on the plus side you can easily switch applications in s60 (just hold down the application button or press it once to bring up the apps menu) but it seems stupid that i can\\'t read my e-mails while one is sent in the background wm5 and 6 can do this also the mail client will only ever download headers never message contents what this means for you: you need to wait for your message to download to read it on the plus side you can select several messages and have the phone download them all at once (hold the pencil key and click on the messages you want to select) same goes for marking messages as read\\n\\non the upside s60\\'s imap support is wonderful: this means push e-mail without needing an exchange account (push gmail anyone) and the ability to subscribe to folders of your choice\\n\\ns60 like blackberry os and windows mobile have some special hardware keys in this case s60 has the pencil key the apps key the multimedia key and the c key the pencil key has to do with all things input related (like switching between predictive text modes or different languages) and if you hold it you can select text for copying and pasting (wm6 and the iphone can\\'t do that) and yes: c/p works in all applications the apps key is used for switching running apps (hold the button) or choosing an app to run (press it) by default apps are quit when you hit the hang-up button (much simpler than in wm6) the multimedia key is basically another four shortcuts for you to have access even if they aren\\'t multimedia related the c key is a universal delete button (not a universal \"back\" button like in wm6 or bbos) so whatever you have highlighted will be deleted keep that in mind i bring this up because knowing how to appropriately use these buttons elevated any s60 smartphone from being a phone with a fancy ui to a true smartphone and allows you to take full advantage of the device (c/p is soooooooooo useful when you finally make use of it including copying and pasting phone numbers from an phonebook entry into a text message for somebody)\\n\\nother advantages of s60 include it\\'s compatability with various devices (bluetooth gps devices work flawlessly every time wm6 can\\'t say that it also works with bluetooth keyboards which the iphone can\\'t do) it\\'s damn stable (you may on occasion have to reboot it but it\\'s so fast and so easy to deal with that it\\'s hardly worth mentioning) has phenominal battery life (admittedly some apps like qik will really take it out of the phone but you can listen to the internet radio all day and still have some power left over in the evening) an easy to use ui (it\\'s not the prettiest but people won\\'t be all \"i don\\'t know how to work your phone\") and its mac compatibility (out-of-the-box syncing support with isync nokia media transfer makes manipulating files on the phone easy including syncing pictures videos music and installing apps) granted: 90% of the apps for working with your phone are for windows but everything you *need* is in mac os and nokia is developing more apps for mac os as evidenced by their recent release of the nokia maps loader (which allows you to download maps and load them onto your phone with the choice of either downloading the entire country or just a few states) definately consider getting a bluetooth gps unit as you\\'ll be able to use nokia maps (it doesn\\'t have all the awesome text-to-speech features of a good n&uuml;vi but it gets the job done the maps application and the maps are free but there is a fee to use the navigation feature though it is competitive relative to the gps fees from cell carriers) geotag your photos geocache (geocache navigator says it\\'s an n95 app but it runs fine on the n73 and it doesn\\'t even complain) and even keep tabs on your walks runs or biking stats with sports tracker (very cool application and free did i mention that)\\n\\ni\\'d give the n73 five stars if it wasn\\'t for the lack of wifi (which would make up for edge) it\\'s poor e-mail client it\\'s rather small amount of ram (you\\'ll hit the ram wall if you upgrade the firmware

       " \"this phone has weathered surprisingly well so far (of course i do take good care of it)  although the phone is somewhat large it has a very nice looking aesthetic (imo others might find it ugly) and on top of that it has an excellent inner and outer screen  pictures taken with the built-in camera won't do the inner screen justice you have to load up your own pictures or use the preloaded wallpapers and themes before you can really appreciate the screen\\n\\nthe battery life is a commonly listed complaint with this phone and i have to admit it's a very valid one  battery life should be enough to last you at least one day if you're an average user however heavy users may find the battery life problematic  battery drainage depends on what apps you use  any app that uses java (games) or accesses the memory card (music player) will use the most power  you may be able to squeeze in a couple of days if you use all of the power saving options available and use it like a regular phone however if you're a user like me who plays games and music on the phone you'll find them almost completely ineffective  my personal preference is to turn off the power-saver for the mini display and have it show the analogue clock screensavor asap (5 sec)  the analogue clock is much easier to read than the power-saver clock (which is the same as the digital clock) and you can easily see it even after the backlight has shut off (i do have the power-saver on for the main display)\\n\\nsurprisingly enough even though the inside main display is near impossible to see in direct sunlight the mini display can be seen perfecty well (in almost all sorts of lighting conditions for that matter)  it seems they use different kind of lcds for them and i wish they'd use the same on the main display as the mini one\\n\\nusing the auto-flip button and looking cool doing it is almost an art  it sometimes doesn't work that well when the phone held at certain angles (namely straight upright) and works best when it is held at near horizontal (up to about 40 degrees)  make sure your fingers aren't blocking the upper lid when you do it  take a few moments practicing it and you'll be doing it like a champ because not having the auto-flip work right in public makes you look like a complete dork :p\\n\\nthe best thing i like about the phone that i wasn't expecting has to be the active idle mode  gives me quick access to music lets me put a quick note directly on the display and gives me quick access to apps as well as direct links to webpages (accessed through tzones)  that coupled with the customizable shortcut buttons makes the phone very convenient to use\\n\\nmy main complaints other than the battery life is the buggy bluetooth music and the blocked web access for java apps  i find the music app easily crashes when using a bluetooth headset with it and i've already tried three different headsets with it  while you can't use mp3s directly as ringtones you can still incorporate them as part of a theme if you're into custom theme building  as others have mentioned the camera button is easily pressed so it's best to use the auto-keylock if you don't want it to take pictures of your pants/purse  i use a phone holster myself and don't usually have that problem\\n\\noverall i like this phone a lot  it's a beautiful phone and quite handy at times\",\n",

       " '*** update to my previous review*** after using this phone for over 9 months now i thought i would update the review and actually increase the rating to 35 stars (from 25)  the original review with its criticism still stands but i recently tried the sony-erriccson w300i and that has made me appreciate this phone more  despite its big and bulky (and somewhat unnatractive) looks this phone has held up pretty well and offers a lot more than the sony w300i definately a better purchase than the sony and both can be had for free from att  a quick summary of the plus points that make this better than the sony better camera better internal and external screens better buttons better music player visuals uses micro sd which is easy to find and cheap\\nthe only positives of the sony are that it comes with the headphones it has voice dial and the battery life is excellent  it is also smaller and looks slightly better although it is made of cheaper plastic\\n\\n*** original review ***\\ni have been using this phone for several months now so i am over the wow phase of having a true mp3 player in the phone  while this phone does have many unique features the overall execution makes this just an average phone\\n\\nappearance - the first thing that you notice is that the phone is rather large  although some may say that this is due to the wonderfully big screen the fact still remains that this phone is not as easy to carry as a lot of other phones available today  another note about this phone\\'s appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model  i purchased the red model just so that i could get a bit of color but the phone still looks plain  there is nothing about this phone that is stylish or even has a \"cool\" factor  the keypad is really a letdown with no tactile differentiation between keys and it just looks plain compared to phones like the motorola razr\\n\\ninterface - at first the interface of the phone looks really simple and easy to use  there are graphical icons that take you to different feature sets and then there are pop up menus that come up under each selection  sounds great right  well the problem is that the features are all over the place  nothing is where you would really expect it to be and you will refer to the manual a lot in the beginning  even after you have some experience with the phone you will still be frustrated because you will have to search through the menus to find the features that you only occasionally use\\n\\nfeatures - the phone is a 3g phone which means if you want (relatively)high speed internet or the ability to watch streaming videos/tv on your phone then this should work better than the non 3g models out there  personally i don\\'t get why anyone would pay such ridiculously high monthly fees for the cingular data services just for the \"privilige\" of watching tv on a 2 inch screen  apart from that the phone has most of the standard cell phone features available out there including quad band gsm bluetooth (including bluetooth stereo headphone compatibility) and a nice 2 megapixel camera  the camera takes wonderful pictures (as long you hold your hand still) but the video is pretty lousy (hey its a cell phone not a camcorder) despite all of these nice features there is one major omission in the feature set and that is the lack of voice dialing  this is truely a sin in this phone because what is the point of having handsfree bluetooth if you still have to pick up the phone and search the phonebook to dial a number while driving  another big minus with this phone is that it does not include any cables to connect it to your computer normally i would not care if a cable was included with a cell phone but lets not forget that you have to have a way to get songs onto the phone  not a problem if you have a blutooth adapter on your computer or you buy a micro sd card with an sd adapter to just put the songs directly on the card but samsung is really going cheap by making this phone have a proprietary connector and then making you pay extra to buy it\\n\\ncall quality - definately a dissapointment with this phone  the phone sometimes has the signal drop to zero bars and then a few seconds later come back to 5 bars  this is very annoying and something i have not experienced with any of my other cell phones i have used over the years  also the quality of bluetooth connections is definatley below average because if the phone is in your pocket or purse you will hear crackling sounds over the connection (i have tried 3 headsets with this phone and all experience the same crackling)\\n\\ndisplay - this is one of the shining stars of this phone  the screen is very nice and large  it is bright and easy to use in most lighting conditions  another great feature is that you can change the appearance of the numbers that display while dialing a phone number  my favorite is the quill setting that gives the appearance that the numbers on the screen are being written with a feather quill really a nice touch  the external display on the other hand is a major letdown  it has a small font which makes it difficult to read without straining\\n\\nmp3 function - this is the main attraction point of this phone and on this end samsung has done a decent job the song title displays on both the internal and external screen and it is easy to create playlists and navigate to the song you want  the phone also supports micro sd cards so you can have a 2gb mp3 player everywhere you go  the main problem is that it comes with no headset and it has a proprietary connector so you have to buy the samsung brand or just get yourself some bluetooth headphones  the phone does have an internal speaker that surprisingly sounds decent and gets loud enough to be able to share your music in a car or quiet room  the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phone\\'s front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds  this is extremely frustrating because you have to hold down the unlock button so that you can get them to work again  why couldn\\'t samsung just reverse the function and make the buttons stay on until you decide to manually lock them\\n\\noverall this phone does have a lot to offer (especially if you get it for free or for less than $30) but it simply does not hold its own when compared to the other music phone options that are available',\n",

       " \"i bought this phone because it was super cheap with a contract extension and it had a nice set of features unfortunately i was ready to send it back just moments after taking it out of the box the first problem that i had with it was that the back is very hard to open i'm pretty sure that the latch mechanism will fail eventually then within five minutes of removing the plastic from the screen the screen had a deep scratch on it i don't know how this happened - i was just fiddling around with it in my hands other than the back cover the phone strikes me as fairly solid and the slider seems sturdy enough\\n\\nthe music player seems to work just fine - haven't had any problems with it it sounds terrible coming from the speaker but with just a cheap $10 pair of headphones the music sounds quite nice i was very impressed with the sound quality i haven't had any problems with any kind of hissing sounds using the adapter\\n\\nthe nokia software is very easy to use - no problems transferring files or anything like that\\n\\nthe fm radio also appealed to me and it works ok i've read review that said the radio only works with the headphones but that's not really accurate the headphones need to be plugged into the phone to function as an antenna but once you plug them in you can choose to have the sound come from the phone's speaker\\n\\nmost aspects of the phone's interface are straightforward and intuitive and i don't really have any rants or raves there like every other reviewer i was shocked at the short battery life sometimes i've even had to charge the phone during the day after having charged it all night oh - an annoying thing - maybe some helpful reader can clue me in on this one - is that when i plug in the phone to charge it the screen backlight turns on and it stays on for the duration of the charge i can't figure out how to turn it off\\n\\nthe screen quality (other than its tendency to scratch) is excellent very bright easy to read nice color but i'd agree with the earlier reviewer who said that the clock is too small i don't wear a watch and depend on my phone to keep me on time\\n\\nother than the button on the back cover the other buttons are fine the power button and side buttons are harder to manage than i'd like but they're not terrible the keypad has great buttons and is easy to use accurately\\n\\nas other reviewers have mentioned the voice recognition function is useless it has never understood anything i've ever said to it i have a a pebl that is from the uk and only understands british english but that phone still understands me most of the time (they both use a speaker-independent system where you don't record voice tags or train the phone)\\n\\nthe camera is ok but i'd never use it in place of a regular digital camera the pictures just aren't that good after taking a picture the phone prompts you to save or send the picture which is annoying but if you push the camera button again it will go back to taking pictures and will save the last picture taken to your default location\\n\\ni don't text or use the web on this phone so i can't say much about that  i have found the software it uses for guessing which words you type is not quite as good as that on the motorola phones i've used in the past\\n\\nwhere this phone was most disappointing to me was its function as a phone i was surprised by this as nokia has such a good reputation and motorola is supposedly not as good - but i found the reverse to be true in this case i've had a lot of reception problems with this phone with my pebl it was very rare for me to have any kind of problem with dropped calls or bad reception but it has been an ongoing issue with this phone i've also had issues with the phone not ringing when someone calls - they get the voicemail and leave a message but when i check the voicemail the message isn't there this happened three times over the three weeks that i used the phone (and i don't get a lot of calls so three is a significant percentage) even when the reception seemed good i was still told that my voice sounded a little fuzzy when i switched back to using my pebl my friends all heard the difference immediately my home office is in a closet that is partly underground and i only very rarely had problems with the pebl in there but the nokia is useless in that room the pebl also works better with my bluetooth headset\\n\\nso this phone was bad enough that i stopped using it and went back to my pebl which is a far superior device (though not perfect by any means) still the nokia was such a bargain (especially with the 1gb card) and has so many other functions that it's nice to have around my daughter uses the mp3 player radio and camera\",\n",

i could then sync all my numbers to my moto q smartphone (windows mobile 6)\\n\\nwell duhh what about my silly sim card - well that\\'s a great concept and all but the slvr defaults to save contacts on your phone not the sim card  so either i manually open 300 entries and click edit then click save to then click sim card on a slvr/razr ordo the export/import from the phone tools program - the export was faster for me  also back in 2003 or so my pre-cingular at&t sim card would not work in my cingular slvr/razr so i didn\\'t even attempt to see if my cingular sim would then work in my post-cingular at&t phone anyways\\n\\n[yes an at&t retail store could have likely synched the contacts between each phone but this was thanksgiving and i was anxious to use my new phone so keep that in mind too ;-)]\\n\\nwhat\\'s in the box:\\n===================\\n1 a post-cingular now new at&t sim card\\n2 a mini-usb to micro-usb keychain (unfortunately the phone uses micro-usb not the ubiquitous mini-usb of the entire motorola line and most other devices oh well)\\n3 a regular usb (computer) to micro-usb data cable\\n4 an a/c outlet micro-usb charger\\n5 a micro-usb to 35mm audio jack adapter\\n6 the phone\\n7 cd and manuals and a 30 day unlimited at&t music download coupon\\n8 two batteries slim and extended\\n\\nwhat i don\\'t like:\\n===================\\n1 why micro-usb   it\\'s not that much smaller than mini-usb - mini seems more sturdy and micro-usb feels uhm plasticky and fragile\\n2 1/8 battery bar means your phone is about to completely turn off with no warning whatsoever - but don\\'t get me wrong the extended-battery life is pretty phenomenal at 3+ days of regular usage with voice and data  my slvr/razr would beep to let me know it was low the q simply goes dead real quick (after 3+ days as i was testing it out) - there may have been a warning but i never got to see it\\n3 apparently windows mobile software (on our work phone and this one) doesn\\'t remind you that you missed an appointment alert missed call or have unread messages - i fixed this by downloading the don\\'t forget freeware app that does exactly that\\n\\nwhat i do like:\\n================\\nin 10 years this is one of the best phones i\\'ve owned  i like it better than our windows mobile 50 blackjack 1 we use at work  battery life is great with my regular usage and i specifically wanted this phone because it is almost as thin as my slvr/razr  i\\'ve seen the treo and htc\\'s and others but those things are as thick and heavy as the cell phones back in the 90\\'s  i personally wanted windows mobile software for all of the many apps as opposed to the new blackberry devices (curve or pearl) - plus the fact we use a microsoft exchange server that directly pushes to a windows mobile 60 smartphone\\n\\nalso i wanted gps and i did a ton of research and enough people got the \"free\" gps software to work that i trusted others\\' experiences and the phone has practically paid for itself just for the amount of frustration/time the gps has saved me  yes google maps and windows live mobile maps do work  i took all default gps settings and launch google maps to lock in on the satellite then use windows live mobile for my gps navigation because it has voice recognition and the screen centers on my gps location and will auto-recalculate if you go off route - haven\\'t figured out how to make google maps do the same  (i have no need to pay $10 a month for telenav - the free stuff works great)\\n\\ni have unlimited data and yes the mp3 and video work fine though video is too small for anything serious to watch  i bought and put a 4gb sd hdsc card in the microsd slot - the guy told me hdsc is the newest and fastest or whatever  not sure what the capacity is but 4gb holds a lot like thousands of pictures and music and probably half a day of video  i\\'ll assume they make 8gb and 16gb microsd cards too\\n\\nthe camera (with built in steady flash-light) is 20 megapixel which is more than the 13mp verizon version of this phone  highest resolution is 1600x1200 and i think the pictures look good for a camera phone but of course it is not a digital camera substitute though for me it was my substitute for when i was in europe and i\\'m happy with all pics even at night\\n\\nkeyboard is full qwerty and super easy to use and i\\'m so fast with it now i turned text prediction off since it would actually mess me up\\n\\nvolume (ear and speaker) is pretty incredible i actually have it slightly more than half way because it can get too loud - which is a good thing\\n\\nvoice recognition is an exponential step up - in old school days you had to \"program\" the voice names by recording your voice - this one is smart enough to guess based off your contacts and it recognizes pretty good  you can say call john work or call sally home or even send text sally mobile or open windows live search etc  (all with no voice programming)\\n\\ni won\\'t go into all of the other windows mobile features or apps - as i assume they\\'d work the same on any smartphone i\\'m just highlighting the unique things for this specific phone\\n\\nscreen is nice and clear and readable in the brightest of sunlight (unlike my old slvr/razr)\\n\\noverall this is truly one of the best phones i\\'ve ever used and i\\'ve been extremely happy with it  all of my apps are installed on my 4gb microsd card and i\\'ve only had one lockup when i had the media player outlook email text messages google maps windows live maps and opera all running  now i specifically choose to exit each app if i know i won\\'t need it anymore and i\\'ve been fine\\n\\ni feel so extremely productive and i have it all in one slim device; bluetooth internet phone incredible volume output no-training-needed voice recognition sync ms-office gps mp3 player video player 2mp camera with 8x digital zoom great battery life email text message bright screen in sunlight 3g and edge data great att phone network (us and intl) and microsd for storage expansion',\n",

buggy i will tell you about that\\nwhen you have an email it also goes into your inbox for text messages so when you go and try to delete all the text messages fast then you will most likely delete some of your emails in that inbox and then that deletes them from your email inbox\\nrecieving ringtones using bluetooth\\n\\nokay so when you get a blackberry the first thing you think of is business user phone only well they aren\\'t just for business users they are for anyone and everyone  by far this is the second best smartphone i have used (number one being pocket pc)  anyways for this phone there is a whole bunch of features jam packed into a small package  i had upgraded mine for the new operating software for upgraded features you can also do it just ask me about it and i can help you out so here is the info\\n\\ncamera feature- this camera is a 2 megapixel camera which puts out very decent pictures and the flash is very bright for just 1 led light  for the upgraded software there is a video feature for the phone but there is a problem with the feature  if you don\\'t have a memory card you won\\'t be able to use the video feature because you get a message saying \" to record a video insert a formatted media card  then there is digital zoom in the phone which works pretty good and unlike most digital zoom out there you don\\'t to really worry about blurred pictures if u move during the time your taking the picture  i would give it 5 stars\\n\\nbrowser- the browser is fast and easy to use but for the upgraded version there is a cursor or arrow just like your computer so you can navigate around using the cursor  i would give this 4 and 1/2 stars\\n\\ngps- now for the gps where i happen to live is a little glitchy  when i am in an area it says that i have no satelitte connection when i have had a connection there before which makes no sense and then i will go there another day and end up having it work fine all in all i would give it 3 and a half stars\\n\\nmp3/video player- i haven\\'t tried these yet but will be sure to have an update when i do try it 0 stars\\n\\nkeyboard-  the keyboard on the phone is as you know a full qwerty keyboard which helps alot and makes it very easy to message fast on  the keys look very small but are indeed very easy to easy to use  also the trackball makes navigation very easy and fast also another thing i noticed is that if your a very fast texter like me  the phone actually can keep up  my old blackjack by samsung was to slow and i would be done with my message if it was long about 10 seconds after i was finished  so i will happily give it 5 stars\\n\\nsound- the speaker for ringtones is very loud and one thing i didn\\'t like is that it was actually a little to loud for mp3 ringtones but then after the upgrade it got quiet but then i think it got to quiet so in all i give it 2 stars for being to quiet and 3 for being loud but then for being to loud\\n\\nearpiece-  there was a big problem i ran into and that was the earpiece  it is simply to quiet  if i am at the mall or somewhere sorta loud but not to loud i can barely hear the person on the other end and for that i have to give that idea 1 star\\n\\nbattery life-  for the battery it is very good if you don\\'t use the messenger or internet or anything but if you do use them use them like i do and i have to be then its not that great  if i stay logged into the blackberry messenger and hotmail messenger that i have downloaded then the battery cuts down alot it will only survive for about half a day but then if you don\\'t use that stuff it will last like 2 to 3 days 5 for not using the stuff and 2 for using the browser and stuff\\n\\ncustomizable-  the blackberry curve is a very customizable you can change the themes that change how the phone looks and there are alot out there on the internet  some you have to pay for and others are free but there are alot of good free themes out there ask me for a website and i will tell you where to find them but there could be changes like being able to make it so you don\\'t have to have icons on your desktop at all times which is something i would really appreciate  3 and a half stars for not having the possibility of taking icons of your desktop but yet having the option to download themes\\n\\nservice- the phone gets great service where i live and thats up in the hills area though i am sure the higher i go i will end up losing service  but for where i am i do notice a difference in my old phone to this blackberry 4 and a half stars\\n\\nprocessor speed- sure the processor is 312 mhz but the problem is that it gets very laggy when you start adding to much stuff to the phone and open to much stuff without closing there properly it works fine but when to much stuff is on it thats when it gets slow\\n\\nall in all i still will give it the 4 and a half stars but since i cant give it that i will just give it 5 blackberry has earned it i would totally recommend this phone to people of all ages and not worry it just being for teenagers or just adults  i hope i gave enough information for you to get this phone or not to get the phone but i don\\'t know but just comment me to let me know what you think',\n",

       " 'the palm centro is one of the very few smartphones that can fit in your pocket and still deliver quality power features  however it has a few minor drawbacks\\n\\nscreen\\ni\\'ve owned a palm iiixe palm tungsten c ipaq rx4240 and have test driven an iphone blackjack ii and moto q and a couple blackberry models  the palm centro is probably the smallest screen of them all save the blackberry pearl  however the centro offers 320 x 320 resolution which is higher than most windows mobile smartphones and pdas out there  the result is a small but crisp display with adjustable font sizes for most applications  i found the touchscreen to be about as sensitive as other palm devices in the past which is to say it\\'s fine (see stylus comments below)  the screen is slightly recessed into the phone which i find to be necessary so i don\\'t hit the screen with my fat face while talking on it\\n\\nkeyboard and buttons\\nhave you seen this thing  the keyboard is small  and you know what  i\\'m glad it is  the moto q blackjack and curve etc might fit in the front pocket of your tight jeans but it\\'s not comfortable  the centro passes my \"jeans test\" by sliding into my front pocket while letting me sit and stand with no problem  as a result you get a smaller screen and a smaller keyboard  the blackberry pearl is the about the same size as the centro but it doubles up two letters per key button  personally i hate that  the centro scores huge points for giving me dedicated keys for each letter on a small phone that fits in my pocket  it took me a day to adjust to typing with my fingernails and i have large hands  but i can easily type with two thumbs or one--something that i can\\'t do on my palm tungsten c or the moto q  therefore centro is an outstanding one- or two-handed phone  the 5-way directional key also works better than i thought it would  after moderate use i find myself actually liking it a lot  the remaining buttons work just fine and can be assigned to whatever you want including the side button below the volume keys  the dedicated ringer-off slider on the top is a very welcome bonus\\n\\nsoftware\\nthe centro comes with a great suite of software preloaded onto the phone  the two email programs work very well with pop3 and imap email accounts although i prefer the versamail over sprint mobile mail  i\\'ve also been somewhat partial to the palm organizer over ms outlook  it also comes with documents to go which lets you open and edit word and excel files and lets you view powerpoint and pdf files  there\\'s a free download available to upgrade docs to go so you can open office 2007 files and it gives you some basic power point editing abilities  the googlemaps and im software are nice and work very well  the entertainment package of ptunes sudoku and solitaire are nice and work ok however i found that sprint tv had some problems syncing up audio and video  the video seemed a step behind  but i loaded slingplayer for palm os on it and the centro works great for watching pocket-sized tv in conjunction with a slingbox\\n\\nthe palm os gets knocks for being outdated however it works very well and is simple to use  plus it\\'s alot snappier than windows mobile  it doesn\\'t really multitask although some programs like im let you sign onto an aol msn or yahoo account and still receive messages after you\\'ve backed out of the program  the centro syncs easily with vista and xp but i haven\\'t tried it on a mac  the other benefit is that there is a plethora for palm software apps out there both free and for purchase\\n\\nthe web browser is just ok  i find that it loads pages much quicker than internet explorer on win mobile devices  unfortunately it\\'s not quite as good as opera mobile and definitely not as good as the iphone\\'s safari (to date nothing isnot even close)\\n\\nphone/voice\\ni\\'ve been on us cellular and cingular/at&t networks for years and never used sprint  sprint service is fine in my area and the voice quality of the phone is nice  the earpiece volume can be raised to high levels when in noisy areas and people on the other end said my mic has no problems and sounds like any cell phone  the centro syncs well with my plantronics 640 bluetooth headset and people on the other end say i sound great with it  after 3 weeks i haven\\'t been able to complain about the phone or data signal  the addition of a wifi radio would have been nice but so far i haven\\'t really missed it because of the high speed ev-do network touted by sprint\\n\\ncamera\\nit\\'s a 13 megapixel camera which is pretty weak by 2007/2008 standards  there is also no flash  the camera actually takes decent pics though  i never even consider the camera on the phone when i buy it but if it\\'s really important to you you probably want at least a 2 megapixel one with a flashso maybe pass the centro on by\\n\\nproblems and shortcomings\\nthere are a couple things that annoy me about this phone and keep it from a full 5 star rating  first the stupid palm connector at the bottom  i\\'ve always hated the palm connectors  why the company can\\'t switch to mini-usb like the rest of the world is a mystery to me  the jack isn\\'t the easiest to pull out it\\'s big and i have to buy all new car chargers for it  also there\\'s no cradle  my previous palm devices have a cradle and i miss it although this is cheaply remedied with some poking around the internet  the stylus is also very thin lightweight and cheap  as a result it\\'s doesn\\'t provide enough tactile feel and weight to effectively use the touchscreen  i had to purchase a replacement metal stylus to bring the touchscreen use up to par  again a cheap fix just a little annoying  even with these shortcomings i would still be inclined to give the centro 5-stars except for:\\n\\nthe battery cover  ugh the manifestation of evil itself  you have to take the battery cover off to remove the sd micro card  you also have to take the batter cover off to reset the unit  now i\\'ve only had one system crash in the first 3 weeks but that was because i was trying to load some really old aol software that wasn\\'t designed for this palm os version--and i paid the price  the cover isn\\'t the worst thing to get off but putting it back on sure is  i\\'ve kind of gotten the hang of it but man total loss of a star because of it  there is no inset reset button on the back of this phone like other palm devices of yesteryear  having one of these small reset buttons in the back could have made me somewhat overlook the battery cover  bummer  palm what were you thinking\\n\\noverall\\nif you want a qwerty smartphone but don\\'t want to lug around a bulky unit your choices right now are either this or the pearl  and

       " \"i like the treo centro it runs on the very dependable sprint cdma/ev-do network but it is the same phone as the treo 600 that came out back in 2003 palm decided that since the 600 was such a big success that they had no need to make any kind of effort in designing a new phone this holds true with the centro this phone has the (((same))) hardware as the treo 600 650 700 750 ect just a bit more memory and a so-called updated os the os might have an update number of 549 but there is zero difference in the os i can not tell a difference at all this is sad seeing as they made a lunix based os called cobalt years ago and it has never seen the light of day\\nthe centro still has the same bugs as every treo since the 600 start-up time is very slow which is really bad when you are in need of making an important phone call and the phone resets for no reason making you wait up to 60+ seconds for it to come back online the limited ram of 64mb's is so much lower then most pda's currently on the market you can use zlaucher to transfer programs to a memory card but this can not be done with all software and since the web browser uses ram not memory cards you still only have 8mb's to work with in blazer all software must be loaded into ram before being it can run so prepare for the phone to reset at least once a day to get the those limited ram resources back\\nstill no wifi which was the complaint in 2003 and palm has not added it yet the centro still has the same 312 mhz intel xscale processor signal strength is still pretty strong but voice quality is still not great when compared to every other phone i have used before\\n\\nsprint is marketing this as an affordable pda at $99 with a contract but when you know that the hardware is going on 5 years old price really doesn't make current pda owners care a whole lot i bought the centro because i hated my motorola razr 2 and i needed to get something better but after using the centro for over a month now i see no difference what-so-ever in this pda and the treo 600 and 650 that i owned a few years ago smaller packaging but the same phone the centro is a good example of what a pda maker should not do while motorola nokia samsung htc ect have all updated their lineups with powerful pda's palm has sat idly by doing nothing with their forum star power palm used to control a huge chuck of the pda software market but now microsoft has caught up and passed palmos by no new companies have used palmos let me rephrase that no one is using the palmos anymore; except for palm\\nso if you don't have a pda and want an affordable one then the centro might be for you if you want power then sprint has much better pda's then the aged and milked-to-death treo's\\nmore then likely the centro will be the last pda-phone ever made by palm they have lost crazy amounts of market share and have been laying off employees so who knows maybe the centro will be a collectors item a pda that has never evolved never been fixed never been changed in any meaningful way treo\",\n",

       " \"i've been a fan of the palm os for well as long as i can remember  some criticize how windows mobile seems to update more frequently or make things look way cooler or whateverdoes the look of the program you use matter that much in the real world  nope  sure it'd be nice if palm made regular upgrades in their software but to be totally honest the system is ridiculously simple to use and since it needs so little in the way of upgrades i guess it makes sense to leave well enough alone  but again i know many who find palm old outdated or just not sophisticated enough and so have decided to go with windows mobile instead which is finego with what works for you  let's get down to business:\\n\\nthe centro is smaller than previous palm devices namely the phenomenally popular treo line which virtually invented the smartphone industry  i have gone all over the 'net looking for comparisons so i would have a good idea of how to compare the centro to say the treo 755p and i must say that looking at photos simply cannot do it justice  on the surface the centro looks only slightly smaller than the 755pbut i assure you in reality it is much smallermaybe too small\\n\\nlet me explain:  the smartphone field is becoming more and more convoluted as more models become available almost daily from the new blackjack 2 to newer sleeker blackberry's or even the moto qall have nice features and programs unique that make them great for specific uses but i submit that the full qwerty keyboard is one of the main reasons why these phones are so convenient  i do not have big fingers and yet i found the centro's keyboard very difficult to type on  i never thought i'd say it but it's just too dang small to use with any kind of ease provided you have normal to large fingers  i would imagine my 15 year old daughter would be able to text at lightning speed but without handling this palm device in person you just may be making a rather expensive mistake  other than that i was most impressed with the overall functionality of the centro  one thing i do miss from the 755p model is the rubberized coating which made it fit so wonderfully in my hands without it the centro lacks a certain comfort in use that otherwise may be perfect depending on who you are\\n\\nwhile the centro isn't as thin as several other models available it was definitely thin enough  i've become rather used to my treo 650 for quite some time so even the 755p fit well in my eyes but the centro was downright tiny  it boasts pretty much all the bells & whistles that made the previous treo's so popular and it pulls all that off in a smaller package  it even comes with google maps built in  now that is a nifty feature  what i wish more than anything is for palm to make the centro and treo 755p available to more wireless carriers than they currently do although i certainly won't be holding my breath for that to happen\\n\\nin short if you are a fan of the palm os like i am the centro is definitely worth a lookbut i cannot emphasize enough to get that look in person rather than in photos  if you have trouble using a qwerty keyboard on the regular treo's the centro will only compound that issue i promise you -- otherwise kudos to palm for a great upgrade and nice packaging\",\n",
       " 'i\\'ve had two sprint plans each with a palm centro for 12 months and 18 months in that span i\\'ve replaced the first centro once and the second centro five times these phones are not dropped abused or exposed to moisture beyond that of a jeans pocket the first centro from the later contract was used for 45 cumulative talking minutes and spent its entire lifespan in a leather case on a desk\\n\\nyou might wonder what issues have led to these replacements\\n\\nthe data connector on the bottom of the phone is prone to weakness and moisture damage two separate sprint repair reps have acknowledged this to me when the connector fails the phone enters a hotsync loop repeatedly attempting to sync itself with a nonexistent data cable until the phone battery dies resetting the phone rarely fixes the problem and once it occurs for the first time it will happen again sometimes the phone can appear to boot properly but begins to loop if you attempt to access particular applications like your contacts list\\n\\na second failure point is the headphone/microphone jack when you plug a headset into this jack the phone automatically disables the onboard speaker and microphone a problem arises when the phone thinks you\\'ve plugged in a headset when you haven\\'t when this happens the speaker phone icon disappears on connected calls and neither you nor the other person can hear each other the solution is to plug and unplug a headphone connector until the jack works again but as with the data connector this is only temporary fix\\n\\nmy fourth centro was literally brand new when it failed i\\'d had it for a day and a half when i pressed the red button to turn on the screen to check the time only the keypad lit the screen had failed as i could still receive calls the rest of the phone appeared to work after twice pulling and replacing the battery for a soft reset the phone no longer worked in any dimension this is also common; soft resets sometimes fail completely and you have put in a different battery to make the phone try again\\n\\nwhat\\'s painful about all this is that i actually like the phone the palm operating system is graphically dated but intuitive and quick to use call quality is high there are throngs of third-party applications for palm os the keyboard has plenty of tactile feedback for accurate text messaging even with my large hands battery life is about a week on standby sprint\\'s coverage of the atlanta-midtown area is excellent; i\\'ve only had two calls drop in the entire span i\\'ve used my centro on the merits the phone deserves 4 stars\\n\\nand yet i can\\'t give it that rating because i can\\'t trust it i\\'ve been put in some very awkward social situations because of an inability to access my contact list or make calls were i prone to emergencies having a centro as my sole phone would be very uncomfortable since palm is unwilling to address any of the issues above in a hardware update i can only say that if you must have this phone buy the $7/month sprint replacement package palm\\'s warranty turnaround time is upwards of three weeks with sprint you can have a replacement in-hand within a day regardless of why the phone failed\\n\\nabout a year ago i wrote this review of my centro:\\n\\n\"sizewise it fits easily into a jeans pocket though the finish is so slick that it\\'s also easy to drop texting is almost excellent but for one quirk: where most phones will split an overlong message into two the centro just refuses to accept any characters beyond 160\\n\\nthe sprint version of the centro comes with instant messaging for aim msn and yahoo no google talk yet but that and the other services are available with a third party program called mundu phone functionality and the contact list are well-implemented though i wish they\\'d use more of the touchscreen to show the button icons\\n\\nbattery life varies with the features in use some users report that activating push email can cut it dramatically leave that off disable bluetooth and have the phone automatically turn off at night and you can see up to a week of standby\\n\\nthere are a few advantages to the centro:\\n\\n* the base of applications is huge because palm os has been around forever\\n* it\\'s faster in use than most of the windows mobile phones stable and simple to operate it is possible to slow it down if you install too much garbage\\n* you can tether the phone to a laptop with pdanet or usb modem if you have an unlimited data plan and you won\\'t have to pay the monthly pam (\"phone as modem\") fee a moderate 3g signal yields a download rate of about 30k/s (024 megabits); i\\'ve seen upwards of 100k/s (08 megabits) with a strong signal this is enough to replace hotel broadband and the like\\n* it\\'s a competent personal organizer\\n\\nand a few disadvantages:\\n\\n* no wifi receiver\\n* the integrated browser (\"blazer\") is awful opera mini 4 is a must-have replacement but while it succeeds in rendering pages properly the centro\\'s screen is so small that web browsing becomes a just-in-case feature rather than something enjoyable to use\\n* touchscreen functionality is awkward for similar reasons i do almost all input and navigation with the keypad or the stylus\\n* minimal eye-candy the os feels very 2001 because that\\'s when it was made it looks about five generations removed from iphone but the usability is still quite good pretty costs more\\n\\nthe treo line is mostly equivalent to the centro except with a larger keyboard and screen better battery life and wifi the advantage of the centro is that it\\'s pocketable if you intend to use a belt holster the treo is preferable\"',\n",

       " \"this is my second motorola phone and it simply does not compare to the nokias i have had in the past the reception is lousy and the battery must be recharged every two days -- even if the phone is turned off i bought a new battery thinking that would fix the problem but no two days on a charge whether you use the phone or not my nokias always went a week to 10 days\\n\\nregarding the net 10 service there are problems but overall i am satisfied the cost of ownership is $15 per month -- that is the minimum it costs to keep the phone operating much better than the $60-70/month costs of standard monthly plans however i will likely soon switch to t-mobile prepaid service since a year's activation is available for $100 with per minute costs also at $010 just like net10 since my usage is minimal this should reduce my total cost of service from the current level of $180/year with net10\\n\\nthe net10 service actually gets 3 stars or so i didn't mind the lack of customer service and mindless bureaucracy of the company but the phone gets 1 star and that's just because zero isn't an option i've been burned twice on low-end motorola phones now -- it will not happen again and motorola hasn't convinced me it's worth buying one of their high-end models unfortunately the only nokia net10 offers is a bottom-of-the-line model i mean really bottom of the line my wife has one and it's still better than this awful motorola but i'm looking for more in a phone\",\n",

the lg shine is a plastic phone with metallic components one thing that is not usually noted is that the shine actually has very little metal in its body; it\\'s only the battery cover and some of the front the lg shine doesn\\'t really feel that much more durable than the se if you drop the shine you will certainly damage the screen and/or scratch the body and/or break the phone with something plastic eg sony ericsson a drop will do no more than give a few scratches regarding the slider mechanism the lg shine\\'s \"snaps\" when you open and close it whereas the se\\'s slider is not as snappy due to the difference in the way that the phones slide it isn\\'t really accurate to say that one feels more durable than the other since the durability was one of my biggest concern in getting the phone i did a test of each phone upon cracking open the box: i opened and closed each phone 300 times results: the lg shine\\'s slider remained the same; the se\\'s slider got smoother after the test\\n\\nse: 9/10 shine: 6/10\\n\\nfingerprints/scratchability: the claims that the shine is a fingerprint magnet could not be more true the shine cannot stand to be touched at all walking around with the shine put in my side jeans pocket for a day the shine went in looking stellar and came back looking pretty poor the back plate had obviously been rubbed on the front plate exhibited small but noticeable scratches i\\'m sure you could prevent the shine from getting scratched by getting a screen protector and/or case but the hassle of one is not something that i\\'d want to deal with (not to mention such protection would take away the \"beauty\" of the shine) the sony ericsson as one may predict does not scratch easily same jeans same walk and the se still looked great after there was something that looked like a small scratch on the front screen on the se but nothing a wipe could clean off speaking of which with the lg shine you cannot wipe the phone with any shirt; it will scratch if the fabric of the cloth/shirt is rough a big reason people get the shine is because it looks good well if you don\\'t take care of it like a newborn baby it\\'s going to look like **** and ipso facto it was a poor decision to buy the phone for its looks\\n\\nse: 9/10 shine: 1/10\\n\\nkeypad: people always complain about the keypads of the sony ericsson and the lg shine and say how small they are and how difficult it is to text with them most of these complainers are complaining from hearsay (they repeat what they read/hear from others not from their own experience) the problem of cracking keypads is also a huge concern for potential buyers of the se first to address the keypad the size of the keypad is very usable for texting and other usage i have 6\\'2\" and have large hands and i can still manage to comfortable use the phones\\' keypads texting with both is very easy (albeit not as easy as texting on a razr) the se\\'s keypad is not as responsive as the shine\\'s meaning the click down are not as solid and that the row of numbers are connected so that one press on a number slightly depresses the row but nonetheless it is very solid the lg shine\\'s keypad is like a smaller version of the razr regarding the cracking keys on the se i performed a test to see if this rumor was true over a period of 2 days i had the phone off and during my spare time (which is a lot since it\\'s summer) i\\'ve been clicking away at the keys (with a good amount of pressure i might add) and the keys exhibit no sign of cracking clearly the cracking keys is an issue with older phones (which you could potentially still buy if the reseller of your phone has old stock)\\n\\nse: 9/10 shine: 9/10\\n\\nnavigation: those that say navigation on the shine is difficult are clearly retarded: physically or mentally the joystick on the shine takes no practice to nail it is very easy to use and is not too small the se with no joystick as imagined is also very easy to use my only caveat with the se is that there\\'s no dedicated end call button like my old nokia the numbered menus in the shine are very easy to use\\n\\nse: 9/10 shine: 9/10\\n\\nreception/sound quality: i live in northern california in a well populated city and everywhere i go i get 5 bars with the se and from 3 to 4 bars with the shine i have found the number of signal bars that you get has a big impact on the call quality (as it should) the shine frequently echoes what the other person says and a background static seems to be present in all calls to ensure that i didn\\'t receive a lemon shine i tested a friend\\'s shine and sure enough it was the same my friend told me they didn\\'t notice the static (he probably got use to the poor call quality) the se\\'s reception and sound quality it top notch no complaints whatsoever here even with 3 bars (in a tunnel) the call was still strong\\n\\nse:10/10 shine: 5/10\\n\\nfeatures: se wins hands down read the features at each phone\\'s respective website; i won\\'t waste your time here the lg shine is the most basic of phones the only thing its got over the se is 3g the shine is all looks\\n\\nse: 10/10 shine: 2/10 (absolutely pitiful for a phone be so lackluster in features)\\n\\nother concerns and notes:\\n- the speaker on the se kills that one which is on the shine\\n- both phones have ringtones are loud enough to be heard\\n- both phones can [be modified to] receive games and  but with the se you have more options',\n",

       " 'beware that this is lengthy  i figure that if you consider spending several hundred dollars on a phone the more information the better :)\\n\\nthe first thing to get straight about this phone is that it is not about form but function  it is not the slimmest or sexiest phone out there nor does it have the most awe-inspiring user interface compared to the likes of the iphone  on the other hand it has every capability that you will find on any phone these days:\\n\\n* a 5mp camera with autofocus led flash and vga video recording carl zeiss lens and a 1/25\" ccd (same as in most compact digital cameras)  various shooting modes (macro night night portrait sports etc) iso control flash control w/red-eye reduction  immediately send pictures via bluetooth email mms etc\\n\\n* gps with nokia maps application and optional voice navigation  various third party applications (eg google maps for s60) support its built-in gps as well\\n\\n* 35g (hsdpa) connectivity (see note about models below) this gives clearer voice and much faster data downloads (theoretically up to 35 mbps; in practice i have seen from 900 kbps to about 22 mbps depending on location and time of day)\\n\\n* wifi (80211g) with wep wpa/wpa2 and eap/8021x authentication (for corporate environments)\\n\\n* support for nearly every bluetooh profile in existence: a2dp for stereo audio dun for tethering the phone\\'s internet connection with a laptop (for on-the road use) obex to send/receive files and browse the internal filesystem from a computer\\n\\n* 35mm headset jack infrared port w/send/receive utility fm tuner\\n\\n* \"dual slider\" design: slide display up to reveal numeric keypad; and down to reveal four multimedia buttons (play/pause stop rewind fast forward)  sliding it down also changes the display orientation from portrait to landscape; sliding it up switches it back\\n\\n* symbian s60 smartphone os: in addition to thousands of available generic java (j2me) mobile applications there are also nearly an equal number of native applications that can access additional functionality/hardware on the phone (for instance there is one that uses the built-in accelerometer to control your computer\\'s mouse cursor by simply tilting the phone and another one that uses the built-in gps to \"geotag\" pictures with your location as you use the camera)\\n\\n* built-in applictions include quickoffice to read microsoft office files (doc ppt xls) adobe acrobat lite reader (pdf) realplayer (most media files/streams) home screen \"search\" applet to search the internet and local content various organizer apps (clock w/unlimited alarms phonebook with unlimited entries calendar w/unlimited meetings todos memos reminders) calculator unit converter -- you get the picture  notably absent though is a timer/stopwatch application; however you can easily download a third party one (eg from smartphoneware)\\n\\n* other s60-specific applications include nokia\\'s internet radio to stream live radio streams \"rotateme\" to automatically rotate the screen depending on your phone orientation \"fring\" mobile skype/aim/msn/google talk/etc client google maps with gps support google home screen search applet mobile weather app \"extgps\" to share the internal gps information over bluetooth (eg to the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/nokia-n800-internet-tablet/dp/b000mk4ggm/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txtie=utf8\">nokia n800 internet tablet</a>) youtube player emtube (also for youtube access) etc\\n\\n* one of the best mobile web browsers out there  based on applewebkit (aka ktml the web engine used in the likes of apple safari and kde konqueror) it renders web pages \"as they were meant to be\"  and unlike that other phone that claims to do the same the n95 also has a built-in flash lite player - so web pages that use flash will work as well  plus you are of course free to download and use other browsers such as the excellent super-fast and bandwidth-saving opera mini (operaminicom)\\n\\n* mail client with pop-3 and imap support (including imap-idle aka \"push mail\"; alternatively it can poll at specified intervals)\\n\\n* mac os x users: although the phone does not come with bundled software for mac os x you can download \"nokia multimedia transfer\" (to synchronize photos and music with iphoto and itunes) and an isync plugin (to synchronize the address book calendar todo etc) with your mac - both from nokia\\'s web site  also setting up your mac to access the internet via the phone (providing that you have a data plan eg the $15/month \"media net unlimited\" from at&t) is super-easy: when you first pair with the phone the needed wap/apn information is pulled automatically from your phone\\'s sim card  (ironically this works for nearly every phone except apple\\'s own iphone; this one has a very crippled bluetooth stack and does also not support tethering)  update: i\\'ve learned that such tethering violates at&t\\'s terms of service  moreover there are no  plans available for this phone (or most others) from at&t that specifically allow tethering  if you do so anyway stay under the radar and don\\'t abuse it - eg by using your cellular data plan as your main internet service\\n\\nmodels:\\n=======\\nthere are 5 subflavors of the n95 released to date:\\n* the original n95 (aka n95-1 aka rm-159) targeted mainly the european and asian markets; while it had quad-band gsm (2g) support for use in nearly every country including the usa it had support only for the international w-cdma (umts/hsdpa aka 3g/35g) frequency (commonly referred to as umts-2100)  nonetheless this phone was later made available for retail in the usa as well through nokia\\'s flagship stores online site and 3rd party retailers  it had manual shutter lens protection (you would slide it open to start the camera) 64mb of runtime/dynamic memory (ram) and a 900 mah battery  common complaints about this phone was that it would often run out of memory when several applications were open and that the battery life was too short\\n\\n* the n95-2 (aka \"n95 8gb\" aka rm-320) increased the screen size from 26\" to 28\" (diagonal) increased ram from 64mb to 128mb increased the battery size from 900 mah to 1200 mah removed the slider mechanism for opening the camera lens replaced the sdhc card slot with 8gb of internal flash and replaced the silver faceplate with an all-black design  however the bands supported were the same: w-cdma 2100mhz gsm 850/900/1800/1900 mhz - so although it will work fine with both at&t wireless t-mobile usa and rogers it does not support 3g/35g network speeds in north america  nonetheless as with the n95-1 nokia has sold this phone in north america as well until just a few weeks ago; so possibly this is the phone sold here (unfortunately nokia\\'s own sales channels do not normally make this distinction and amazon\\'s product description is also somewhat lacking)  update: as the product description now clearly says this is the n95-4 (aka n95 8gb nam) model\\n\\n* the n95-3 (aka \"n95 nam\" rm-160) is the first model targeted for north america  most of the exterior design is similar to the n95-1 (silver faceplate 26\" screen sdhc slot) but like the n95-2 it has 128mb of ram a 1200 mah battery and no manual slider for the camera shutter  the main reason for its existence is that it swapped the original umts-2100 (wcdma) frequency for umts-850 and umts-1900 so that it would work with at&t wireless\\'s 3g/35g network  until just a few days/weeks ago this would have been the \"best\" choice for us customers\\n\\n* the n95-4 (aka \"n95 8gb nam\" rm-421) is identical to the n95-2 except that like the n95-3 it swaps umts-2100 for umts-850/1900  it was released just a couple of weeks ago though so if amazon got their inventory of \"n95 8gb\" devices from nokia prior to this it would have been the n95-2 rather than the n95-4  (the exterior and labeling of both is the same)  also the firmware revision numbers are different so some utilities (like the \"nokia multimedia transfer\" application and isync plugin for mac os x) do not yet recognize this phone update: the n95-4 is now fully supported by most applications including nokia multimeda transfer and isync plugin\\n\\n* the n95-5 is for japan; it is a stripped-down version of the n95-1 (eg no wifi) update: as someone commented below it is actually for china\\n\\ncompared with other phones:\\n==========================\\n\\nn95 vs iphone\\n==============\\n\\nthis is almost an irrational comparison given how different these devices are:\\n\\n* the iphone is almost entirely about \"sex appeal\": polished slim with a large screen for viewing content multi-touch user interface (we\\'ve all seen how to zoom in and out using finger pinches do inertial scrolling through a list of contacts etc)  as such it is very big on \"usability\"  the n95 is not even a touch-screen device  (personally i actually prefer \"hard\" keys w/tactile feedback; having used the touch-screen based motorola a1200 ming in the past  touch screens are not very good for for example dialing a number without looking at the screen)\\n\\n* the iphone feature set is at best mediocre  yes it has wifi - so does a lot of other phones  yes it has a \"wysiwyg\" web browser; again so do so many others (including the 3-year old&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/motorola-a1200-ming/dp/b000szokn0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txtie=utf8\">motorola a1200 ming</a> another touch-screen phone by the way)  however it lacks: 3g support gps infrared fm radio decent camera functionality (no flash video recording etc) 3rd party application support (eg no internet radio gps navigation etc) or even a usable bluetooth stack (to do silly little things like transfer files or enable internet access for a nearby laptop while on the road)  even the otherwise crappy motorola razr line (eg razr v3xx) do most of these things update: with the release of the iphone 3g and the new app store apple has come a long way  it\\'s worth pointing out though that the iphone can still not run standard j2me/midp mobile applications only those released specifically for the iphone through the app store  per the apple terms of service this means: no 3rd party web browser (eg opera mini) no voice navigation not even something along the lines of nokia sports tracker (since it uses the gps)\\n\\n* the iphone is only available with a 2-year contract from at&t; the n95 is only available sim-free (unlocked)\\n\\nin short: the iphone is about form the n95 (and symbian devices in general) about function\\n\\nn95 vs&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/sony-ericsson-k850i/dp/b0010pm1ho/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txtie=utf8\">sony ericsson k850i</a>\\n===========================\\n\\nthese are the only two 5mp camera phones available for the us market  neither of them is offered by a carrier (at&t t-mobile cellular one rogers) so in both cases you will pay the full price for the phone  (the upside of course is that you will not need to renew your contract to get it :)\\n\\nalso both phones (in the case of the n95 some flavors of it) support the us 3g bands in addition to being quad-band gsm phones  the difference here is that the k850i supports all four gsm bands and all three umts bands at the same time so you don\\'t have to pick a \"us\" vs \"international\" flavor  finally both phones have built-in fm tuners - though the k850i also supports rdm to display programming information transmitted in the broadcast\\n\\nmost comparisons of these phones therefore center around the camera functionality (eg phonearenacom gsmarenacom and mobile-review com all have head-to-head comparison reviews of the two)  in summary: as far as camera phones go these are as good as you get; they are both comparable to mid-range pocket cameras  the k850i has an advantage indoors because it has a real xenon flash in addition to the led autofocus assist beam  however in general it has more \"washed out\" color reproduction than the more vivid n95; and it only supports video recording in qvga (320x240) resolution compared to the n95 vga (640x480)\\n\\nthe main difference between the phones lie in other areas the n95 is a symbian smartphone and so can run a whole slew of native applications specifically written for this platform while the k850i is limited to running generic java (j2me) mobile applictions  also the k850i does not have a built-in gps (but using an external bluetooth gps receiver together with free gps navigation software such as amazegps you can get voice navigation on this phone as well)  the java version of google maps (which is what you would use on the k850i) has a \"my location\" feature that uses information from cell phone towers to pinpoint roughly where you are within a couple of miles; similar to the iphone  various other limits exist in the k850i as well (1000 phonebook entries 5 alarms etc)\\n\\non the other hand the k850i does have a few built-in applications that are notably absent from the n95: a flashlight application (uses the led autofocus beam) mouse/keyboard emulation to control your bluetooth-enabled computer (eg for presentation) and a stopwatch/timer app\\n\\none last thing to note about the k850i:  although it uniquely supports both us and international 3g frequencies its use on the at&t wireless network is sub-optimal  that\\'s because there is an interoperability issue with its built-in media player and the medianet configuration - so streaming internet videos (eg from youtube) does not work  this was the single most important reason why i ended up returning my k850i to the local store where i bought it after having had it for about 2 weeks\\n\\nn95 vs the samsung g810\\n========================\\n\\nthe samsung g810 was announced at the mobile world congress in barcelona in february; it is another symbian s60 phone with a feature set almost identical to the n95  it will be sold internationally starting this fall; probably not in the us though -- it is lacking the gsm 850 mhz frequency used here (in other words it is only a \"tri-band\" phone)  maybe they plan on releasing a us version as well - i guess that depends on whether a carrier picks it up or not\\n\\nother than that for better or worse the g810 has a 3x optical zoom \"worse\" because that inevitably leads to compromises in the optics (the thickness of the phone is the same so that must mean that the ccd sensor is smaller - meaning more noise)  on the upside it does have xenon flash and a protective lens cap\\n\\nearly available specs also indicate that it will have 96mb of ram - midway between the n95-1 and subsequent n95s; however the ram will be split up into a 32mb chunk for the dsp (gsm and w-cdma radios) and 64mb for the symbian phone os/functionality  thus this could become an issue\\n\\nfor now anther samsung the g600 although not available for sale in the us seems to have a better camera (in some reviews outperforming the n95 and k850i) as well as quad-band gsm support  (it is otherwise a low-end phone though without eg 3g)\\n\\nupdate: other nokia phones\\n==========================\\n\\nsince the n95 several other n-series and e-series phones have been released by nokia with very similar feature sets  for instance the n82 which features a full xenon flash and thus doubles nicely as a pocket camera also for indoor use (though the only version available does not support north american 3g bands just like the n95-1 and n95-2)\\n\\nupdate dec 1 2008: the n95 now has a couple of worthy successors each of which improve on its feature set in different ways: the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/n85/dp/b001ibim00/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txtie=utf8\">n85</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/n96/dp/b001dn5030/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txtie=utf8\">n96</a>  personally i\\'ll stick to the n95 8gb though (see my n85 review to see why)',\n",

       " \"before you begin reading i would like you to know that i have listed pros and cons below so in case you don't like long reviews just read the pros and cons and they'll pretty much summarize everything i've written in here\\n\\ni got this phone about a month ago and i can tell you that its one of the best phone's i've ever owned much sleeker and compact yet just as capable as the curve wifi is a big advantage because i only pay 10 bucks per month for the unlimited email plan and thats it no need to pay data fees wifi inernet browsing is free and i also im via wifi if you go for hotspot@home then all your wifi based calls are free as well no matter what wifi network you're on\\n\\nthe calendar/organizer is great and as one reviewer mentioned it does not update time zones but thats for a good reason - updating time zones will totally affect your business appointments (they would never get updated even if the time zone would've at all) and so the phone is made such that you have to update it manually and while doing so you'll be sure to change your business appointments for the day accordingly\\n\\nthe camera is pretty impressive and i recently created a fabulous album containing assorted images from this phone some of them are impeccable the zoom function is good but reduces resolution considerablybut after all its just 2mp so its meant to be only a back-upsay in case of an accident the video camera is pretty good as well and i've recorded clear crisp videos with it i'm happy\\n\\nsince this is a phone lets talk about calls call quality is superb - both reception and transmission you can talk in the middle of a crowded party and you will still be able to hear very well and your voice will be transmitted to the person on the other end w/o any disturbance due to the powerful noise-canceling mic i have experienced this myself\\n\\nthe few cons of this phone are:\\n\\n1 its internal memory is only 64mb which may be a problem for users who tend to upload too many third-party applications on their phones i have about 7 third-party applications yet i have 17mb left which is quite impressive so for average or slightly heavy users (like me)memory shouldnt be a problem at all for photos and videos the os 43 of this phone can support upto 8gbs of external memory (microsd card) i use 4gb and its fantastici've managed to fill only 500 mb even after uploading several mp3s and a few videos and photos\\n\\n2 the browser is archaic and does not support java apps however rim will come out with newer os versions which one can install on their phones for free and which will address these issues till then you can use free browsers like opera mini which rocks\\n\\n3 screen is smaller than the curve's (not a problem at all for me) which some people may not like\\n\\nthe many pros are:\\n\\n1 amazingly light and compact\\n3 wifi\\n4 heavily customizable\\n5 suretype keyboard (makes typing very easy but may need getting used to initially)\\n6 high resolution display\\n5 external memory expandable upto 8gb\\n7 video capture\\n8 voice dialing\\n9 push email\\n10 very nice organizer\\n11 two speakers instead of one as seen in previous models\\n12 new powerful mic with background noise cancellation\\n\\ni can go on and on about this phone i just want to reiterate that this is a very user friendly highly capable extremely customizable phone and you will have no regrets rim has been making blackberries for ages now and they know what they're doing over the years they've addressed various issues from previous models and the 8120 being one of their latest offerings many issues have been rectified in this phone\\n\\ngo for it and enjoy\",\n",

       " \"i've had my centro for about a month now and have been continually impressed with just about everything about it imho this might very well be the best combination of price functionality and portability\\n\\nprice:-------------------------------------\\nwhile palm seems to have pegged this as a phone for the value conscious it does not seem that any corners were cut the screen is a joy to behold with crisp text and vibrant colors the keys are solid to the touch and though i have fairly large hands typos are not very common and the finish on the phone screams quality the touch screen also works very well and i find that i rarely break out the stylus - which is so wonderfully recessed that it'll take a minute or so before you locate it for the first time\\n\\nfunctionality:-----------------------------\\ni've used both palm and pocketpc organizers and have to say that i really enjoy the simplicity of the palm os while it may be a bit long in the tooth today - its hard to improve upon simplicity especially on a hand held device all the familiar palm applications are there and work just as well in addition there's dataviz's documents to go application that lets you work with pdfs word and excel documents\\n\\nportability:--------------------------------\\nit is amazing just how much has been packed into this form factor a full keyboard a decent screen and good navigation - via a 5 way rocker switch i'm not a big fan of keyboards that swivel or slide into existence since it usually means a thicker body the centro gives me all that i need and will still fit comfortably in my front trouser pocket - so well in fact that i don't even notice it in fact one of my worries is that its just a bit too small for my hands and that i might have it slip through my fingers\\n\\n* * * * * * * * * * * as a phone * * * * * * * * * * * *\\ncall quality and speakerphone abilities are obviously important in a phone and i was very glad that the centro shone in both those departments however people can often tell that i'm on a cell phone and at the maximum volume level there seems to be some clipping on the speakerphone\\n\\ni really like the touch keys that show up when in a call to turn on the speakerphone or to mute the microphone\\n\\nbtw - i used to have tmobile service (with a moto razr) but would constantly run into dead zones within office buildings using the centro with verizon gives me 2 solid bars where i often had none\\n\\ni tend to prefer phones with hard keys however the numeric keypad here is way too small to use - especially one handed hence my primary concern was with how its alternative dialing mechanisms would work - ie touch pad dialing voice dialing and speed dialing features\\n\\ntouch pad dialing:------------------------\\nworks reasonably well - with fairly large sized buttons showing up on the screen what's really cool are the programmable soft buttons that you get at the bottom of the touch pad - called favorite buttons once you've configured these favorites dialing frequently used numbers is as easy as navigating to them and pressing the palm button\\n\\nvoice dialing:------------------------------\\nthis is a separate application by voicesignal my opinion on this is a bit mixed it seems to work reasonably well - but can be very finicky i've played with its customization settings to get it to work better but i'm not sold on it yet\\n\\nthe most vexing problem is that it works by doing a phonetic match between the contact's name and what you say into the microphone while this works for most names it is a challenge when a name is not pronounced as it is spelled i much prefer the alternative - where you record the pronunciation for each contact and the application does a voice print comparison\\n\\nfor convenience the centro lets you invoke the voice dialing application by pressing and holding the lower most left button\\n\\nspeed key dialing:------------------------\\nthis doesn't work quite as well mostly because i can never remember who is programmed on a given key :(\\n\\n* * * * * * * * * * * other thoughts * * * * * * * * * * * *\\nkey guard:------------------------------\\nthe key guard is also simplicity itself i have it set so that the device goes to sleep in 30 seconds if no key is pressed then to wake it up i need to press the power button and the recessed center palm button its kind of annoying especially if you're used to clamshell designs - but its easy to get used to i've heard complaints regarding other phones where the key guard is too easy to bypass resulting in unexpected phone calls being made so far no such problem i've had it in my front trouser pocket - and its never called home\\n\\nsynchronization:------------------------\\ni used the supplied cable to sync this phone to both microsoft outlook and to the palm desktop and both went without a hitch the cable connection at the phone end is a bit scary - it doesn't connect well and i often hit the sync button when trying to detach it\\n\\nthe cable does double duty - as a trickle charger - so its easy to charge up your phone while at your computer\\n\\nusing bluetooth to sync with my laptop took a bit longer to setup however it did go through and now it's a joy to have it sync at the push of a button without having to connect up the cable its not noticeably slower than using the cable and its convenience is awesome\\n\\nbattery level:----------------------------\\nbattery level is sort of a concern looks like a car charger and an additional battery are must-have accessories for me i find that under light to normal usage i have to charge it at least twice a week that's a bit thirstier than i expected but i prefer this to the increased weight of a high capacity battery\\n\\nbattery cover:----------------------------\\nthat brings me to the one problem with this phone that everyone complains about - that the designer must have been asleep during the class on battery cover design it requires brute strength and pure luck in equal measures to slide it open i've done it successfully over a dozen times now but i still haven't quite figured out a technique the positive here is that i do not open battery covers on phone with any regularity the negative is that you need to get this open to do a soft reset (another design class missed it seems) and to properly seat the microsd card (yet another)\\n\\nweb/email/data:--------------------------------\\nthe blazer browser is plenty zippy and i've had no trouble accessing gmail google maps or any of my regular sites the pages render beautifully and the images are surprisingly sharp and clear\\n\\n* * * * * * * * * * * conclusion * * * * * * * * * * * *\\ni agonized over the blackberry devices and the samsung 760 - all wonderful devices\\n\\nhowever as a key selection criterion for me was portability it was simply impossible to ignore this phone combining this with a comprehensive feature-set definitely makes it one of the best on the market\",\n",
       " 'i\\'ve been craving the perfect smartphone for a few years now  seems you had to sacrifice for either size or features  finally this little guy comes along and i literally can\\'t put it down i the features are great and the form factor is perfect  it barely takes up more space in my pocket than the razr it replaced  first as many have mentioned yes the palm os is dated however as dated as it seems it still blows the doors off of most phones out there  i want it simple i don\\'t need a ton of useless apps and fluff bogging down my phone my primary need was for the following: 1) good sound quality 2) robust calendar and alarm feature 3) email capability 4) easy texting 5) decent camera (because you never know when you\\'ll need to take a halfway decent pic in an emergency (auto accidents unexpected events etc)  the centro delivers on all fronts  here\\'s my pros and cons:\\n\\npros:\\n\\nphone:  nice clear phone with great reception (in my area anyway southeastern pennsylvania)  speakerphone is loud and clear  buttons to toggle speakerphone on/off well placed and easily quickly found on touchscreen the layout is well-executed and all buttons/features easy to find callers can be identified by picture and ringtone\\n\\nmessaging: i love the fact that messages are sorted in a chat/im format  it makes it so much easier to keep up with back and forth conversations  and since new messages from someone who has already texted you are appended to the chat log it\\'s very easy to find older messages from certain people  the icons are a nice touch too  i haven\\'t used the email feature  i have a blackberry for that (sorry it\\'s the undisputed champ besides i don\\'t need 24x7 access to my personal email only corporate)\\n\\npim: what can i say it\\'s palm  it\\'s been around for ages so i won\\'t bore you with repetitive info  it\\'s very easy to add information synch with pc and backup data  contacts is great  you can add a lot of extra info (such as anniversaries birthdays etc) for contacts that will be automatically added to calendar  several fields including customizable ones ensure you can enter pretty much any info you desire  pictures can be added to contacts  the palm software will even ask you if you wish to optimize the picture for use on the palm  that\\'s great and saves you the time of re-sizing an 8mp picture so it doesn\\'t gobble a couple mb\\'s on your handheld  haven\\'t really used memo yet but it\\'s basically a rudimentary scratch pad for notes\\n\\ncamera:  the camera is adequate  it\\'s by no means great (i\\'ve yet to find that on any cellphone) but it\\'s on par with the best that\\'s out there now  though only 13 mp images are clear and free from blur  even low-light images are fairly decent half the time  video is ok although not as robust as the still-cam  (see more on this below)\\n\\nextras: there are a few little extras: documents to go versamail pockettunes etc that i haven\\'t bothered to use yet  i did install a 4gb microsd card and keep photos and music on it  desktop software is standard palm fare  if you are unfamiliar with it there are plenty of reviews and info sites on the web  it is extremely easy to install configure and use  internet access is standard mobile phone fare  speeds were pretty good on verizon\\'s network  battery life is great i keep it on all day (power down overnight)  i make calls use the camera frequently use the messaging calendar and contacts and i\\'m on my third day without recharging (although it looks like i may do so tonight)\\n\\nthe fit and finish are fine  although you can tell this phone is geared towards the budget crowd it doesn\\'t feel \"cheap\"  it\\'s just not as fancy as it\\'s bigger brothers however it definitely feels solid and well-built in it\\'s own right\\n\\ncons:\\ni love the keyboard and realize there was no way to keep the form factor this size and make them any bigger  although i don\\'t have big sausage fingers i still sometimes have difficulty navigating the micro-sized keys  someone with larger fingers should definitely try it out in a store first  you can also dial the phone with soft buttons on the touchscreen\\n\\nvideo is a crap shoot  sometimes videos are ok other times the movements are kind of jerky  depends on lighting and how fast your subject is moving fortunately my expectations weren\\'t that high to begin with like 99% of the video phones it\\'s adequate just not great\\n\\nthe usb sync cable is difficult to remove   it almost feels like you\\'re going to break it when you pull it out  there are no buttons or release switches\\n\\nthe battery door is also extremely difficult to remove/replace  you have to push down on just the right place  the microsd card took a couple attempts to seat properly  the instructions said it should \"click\" into place however mine didn\\'t click it just slid in until it stopped  my first attempt i failed to fully insert it and the card wasn\\'t detected  you have to remove the battery cover to access the microsd slot so i wasn\\'t very happy about doing that again\\n\\nother than these few minor annoyances i having yet found any glaring cons with this phone i love it and would highly recommend it if you\\'re searching for a robust smartphone that isn\\'t the size of a brick',\n",
       " 'the centro is a good value - for its target niche--in spite of its many foibles; one pretty much gets what he pays for\\n\\ni bought this smartphone when my pda a palm one tungsten died i chose the centro in spite of negative customer reviews because i am the exact customer for whom it was designed a customer due for his free once-every-two-years upgrade from a cellular provider that does not offer such attractive alternatives as the iphone or palm pre and a long-time palm user with much invested in that operating system: (1) software (even though i had to pay for an upgrade of documents to go that was better than having to license entirely new software (2) familiarity of use and (3) data and programs that could be installed in the new device with nothing more than a routine hotsync\\n\\nthere is much to like about this device: like all smartphones it provides the functions of both a pda and cellular phone freeing up the shirt pocket previously occupied by a pda and integrating my contact list (synchronized with outlook on my desktop) with the dialing function and requiring one (or two if one also uses it for playing mp3s) fewer power adapters be carried on trips\\n\\nanother advantage for those who do want to go beyond the basic applications available on a cell phone but do not want to pay the wireless provider every time they want to load a program ringtone or photo this provides many of the capabilities of an unlocked phone (but not the ability to work on various networks)\\n\\nthe centro is very reasonably priced (you may even get it for \"free\" if one renews a wireless contract that has a \"new-every-two\" or some such replacement feature) there are a number of additional costs that one may encounter however as usual with a new cell phone unless it happens to be an almost exact duplicate one ends up buying a new carrying pouch and car-charger at a minimum; and if one is replacing a pda there is the prospect of having to upgrade third-party software to go along with the newer pda software release then if one uses a memory card one may have to change to a different type in the case of the centro since the battery capacity isn\\'t great one will also need to consider getting at least a spare battery perhaps one with a charger--especially if the centro is to be used as a pda phone camera mp3 player and video & picture viewer we can be thankful though that at least the battery is replaceable a feature that would likely not be the case if this were merely a pda or notoriously an ipod another cost may come about if one uses it to play music because its headset jack is  the 25mm size that is used on phones but not much else; so then one has to buy either a 35-25mm adapter or a new headset entirely  by the way if you are adapting the jack for use with standard a/v equipment or headphones do *not* buy the type of adapter geared specifically to cellphones which is a four-wire thing meant to accommodate a microphone as well as stereo audio; you are likely only to get audio on one channel\\n\\nthis brings me to palm customer support which i am not sure is of this earth i am used to support\\'s being outsourced to the fine people of south asian countries but both of the customer-service p- (well i hesitate to use the term people as i am not quite sure that the presumed humans to whom i spoke were really of our species) er robotrons to whom i spoke were nice enough and answered my questions but were unintentionally annoying in their incessant repetition of the stock phrases which they were trained to use to reassure and mollify the customer as i was not familiar with the tendency of cellphones to use a 25mm headphone/headset jack and as searches of both the provided documentation and the on-line support manuals failed to turn up any mention of why my headphones wouldn\\'t fit i called technical support in exasperation to be told that the only solution was to buy one of the headsets in the palm store they did not mention the possibility of buying a 25-35mm adapter which may not be the most elegant of solutions but is somewhat less expensive than buying new `phones and a much more universal solution should one wish also to connect the device to an a/v system or to one\\'s car audio\\n\\nturning to the centro\\'s shortcomings it--the entire device--is immobilized (pun intended) while recovering from cellular signal loss--a frequent occurrence as it works less well than my previous lg in low-signal conditions\\n\\nit has no reset button which means in the not-infrequent event of its freezing up one has to remove the battery which happens to be difficult because there is no easy way to remove the back cover that pesky back cover also needs to be removed at least sometimes when one inserts or removes the optional microsd memory card\\n\\nthe keyboard is awfully small but almost any relief from graffiti and even tinier lcd keyboards is a welcome one\\n\\nspeech recognition is not so good; furthermore it does not work with the bluetooth; i am still trying to figure out the easiest way to speed-dial my most frequent contacts it is impressive nevertheless that it manages to search through hundreds of entries in my imported outlook contacts for a phonetic match\\n\\nthe bluetooth capability does not include stereo headsets which along with low battery capacity and the 25mm headset jack further discourages the centro\\'s use as an mp3 player\\n\\nthere are at least a couple of parts of the device that are quite flimsy: (1) the stylus which threatens to break like a matchstick at any moment (it\\'s also hard to grasp as it has been made to be so streamlined-flush with the back of the phone); and (2) the power connector (same as on my previous palm tungsten which in spite of its seeming delicacy did not break during its lifetime)\\n\\nsome may consider it a disadvantage that the centro does not accept the most ubiquitous of memory cards sd but instead only has room for microsd cards already being accustomed to microsd in a previous cell phone i was not bothered by this especially now that they come with capacities up to 8gb; and unlike the negligible space savings afforded by the tiny audio jack it can be argued that the difference in size between a standard and a micro-sd is significant in a device with so many functions in such a small space\\n\\nupdating the palm os with the latest version (why was this not loaded before it shipped) was a fairly long (twenty-minute) process with many reboots of the phone not counting the time to find and download the software; and it also required a complete re-sync to put restore both software and data\\n\\nif one is used to a dedicated cellphone there is a bit of a learning curve to figure out where to find the corresponding functions on the centro; on balance the device is more like a pda with telephone features than a telephone with pda features fortunately for me my long-term use of palms made it fairly easy for me to guess where i would find things like text messages and photos during my first week i discovered that i did not have to rely so much on my palm knowledge as at first i thought i would have to there are alerts for messages and missed calls with an almost always \"call\" button available to respond to the call or message\\n\\nthe centro does not come with preloaded software to allow the use of the optional memory card but that software is available for free from the palm website the degree of integration of the memory card varies with the application; eg the mp3-playing software automatically recognizes and uses the memory card; however the picture viewer will only view photos on the memory card if they are first moved to a specific folder a feat not easily accomplished in the phone itself nor explicitly explained in any readily-available documentation; however once one figures out where the picture viewers wants to find pictures he can most easily accomplish the move of photos en masse by plugging the memory card into a home computer\\n\\nthere is a gotcha with respect to the bonus software: one is tempted to download it directly to the phone; but if one does not have a data plan that could be somewhat costly  and for me there was a glitch as i tried to download the software via my pc: it took several tries and one of the aforementioned calls to product support to get the web page to recognize my centro\\'s serial number even though each entry was correct and identical to all the preceding\\n\\nsome other users had complained of a convoluted installation procedure for bluetooth that installation goes fine however if one pays close attention to the instructions although one has to read both those that come with the centro and the attaching device still the handshaking (pairing) between the phone and bluetooth device can be problematic at times (i am new to bluetooth-augmented phones and am wowed with the convenience but annoyed with the sometime-flakiness)\\n\\nthe hardcopy manual that is provided is it admits just the basics unfortunately the manuals provided on cd-rom and on-line aren\\'t really adequate either although certainly more thorough than the printed digest\\n\\nlike many contemporary do-everything devices the centro has features that will require weeks to appreciate over time as i take more advantage of its considerable adaptability through customization and assignment of \"favorite\" buttons i expect that it will grow on me even more',\n",

       " 'april 2010: verizon just released v6 of navigator and now it is pretty good they havce made great improvements to the ui and the map is as good as many dedicated units i haven\\'t used the new version enough to give it a thorough review but the negative comments i originally made about it are no longer valid well except for it still being useless outside of network coverage\\n\\nfirst a few words about the network verizon does have good coverage but i get a lot of vmail when i am sitting at work with 3 bars on both signal meters i also get text messages in blocks i now advise people who get my vmail to just try again a couple of times the message does eventually get through though text messages sometimes result in a \"network error\" message too that\\'s just laziness on their network folks part they need to deal with making sure the message gets through rather than putting it back on to the users\\n\\ni do actually like this phone as a software professional of many years experience that\\'s actually quite unusual; i have high expectations most of the features on this phone work well and it\\'s a reasonable size too given the choice of a bigger phone with a better keyboard or a smaller one that i don\\'t mind carrying well the choice was obvious to me but in the months that i have had it there have been no software updates and they do need to fix some bugs\\n\\nthe phone works well enough not the same as a phone with a proper keyboard or even a phone with a regular keypad a few things you can do with the real buttons but the rest has to be done via the touch controls\\n\\nphone connectivity has been better than with at&t it has never dropped calls at the places where at&t dropped them 100% of the time as an example there was a railway bridge (just north of 84 on mission blvd in fremont ca) where at&t drops 100% of calls verizon doesn\\'t\\n\\nbut on the general phone call quality front the verizon network more often suffers from bad echo i make phone exchanges and echo cancellation is a network issue so that\\'s not the phone but outside of that the voice quality both sent and received though adequate is not spectacular it\\'s good enough comprehensible but not great\\n\\ncontrols are a vast improvement from my motorola phones the best thing of all is that the side buttons are locked when everything else is locked so i don\\'t end up with zero ring volume unexpectedly and miss calls\\n\\nthe display is ok but not as good as my three year old dell 51v pda not by a very long way this makes the net browser of questionable use but zooming in helps with readability if not the quality the data network is not fast nowhere near as fast as at&t but then at&t doesn\\'t have the coverage so a slow verizon net is a lot better than no net at all in many of the places i visit round silicon valley it\\'s rather disappointing though seems like they should be able to achieve more in the tech capital of the us\\n\\ni used bitpim to transfer the comma separated variable (csv) file i exported from my nokia e51 which i liked better as a phone but which lacked gps and good camera though it had much faster data and 80211 too\\n\\nthe camera is pretty good it\\'s about the quality of the $800 olympus i bought about eight years ago or the cheapest digital you can buy now the lens isn\\'t as fast and doesn\\'t have great optical zoom but the sensor is fast so you can get some surprisingly good low light shots the shutter delay is long though and the exposure control with the \\'flash\\' isn\\'t good so you end up with burned out blue-white images if you use it too close to your subject better than nothing though\\n\\nshould i review the navigation as if it were a dedicated gps first the gps features depend 100% on data coverage when you don\\'t have data coverage you don\\'t have gps so don\\'t rely on this as your only form of navigation the big problem with traffic linked navigation systems is that the method of getting the traffic reports in is poor the data tends to be old or missing so you get reports about incidents that were in the distant past or you get no warning before running in to a problem the bay area has a lot of radar based traffic speed monitoring but even that isn\\'t enough to cause either this lg phone or my garmin nuvi 670 to make good traffic related decisions the regular routes chosen are fine and the maps downloaded are adequate but if you are heading out where there\\'s no network coverage then there\\'s no gps guidance either the phone does really use gps not some awful signal strength based triangulation re-routing on bad traffic isn\\'t as good as tomtom or garmin sometimes it even asks you if it should request a new route rather than just getting on with it right now i am wondering if i should continue to bother with the gps or just keep it as a curiosity\\n\\nthe interface to the phone book is different and much less good than the regular interfaces: navigation is a loaded application so it doesn\\'t do things the lg way it should the phone native software has a favorites list a contacts list and a dial pad for selecting numbers the favorites list can use pictures of the recipients in the messaging the favorites are available as a short list under one tab in the gps software there\\'s an option to send a sit-rep to tell people when you will get where you are going it\\'s under the options menu but then you have to hit \\'add\\' to add a contact to the recipient list and then either dial the number or find it in the address book this version of the address book lacks the short cut letter bar so you can\\'t just go to the \\'s\\' entries with one tap you have to search for individual names this is the last thing you want to be doing whilst driving\\n\\nthe email interface is not good it is slow and neither includes the graphics nor can follow links so if your receive html based email you aren\\'t going to know what the message is until you get to a real browser or if you are lucky you can browse to the page on the verizon browser which actually seems ok the email client also crashes on trying to do a group reply and takes the phone down with it they need to improve this and also add some user friendliness like allowing the notification tone to be changed to separate it from other features on the phone\\n\\nthen there\\'s the curious operational bugs/incompatibilities/irritations when it receives an email or text message it just has to tell you right now even if you are busy writing another text couldn\\'t it just beep and flash an icon instead you either have to read the other message now at which point your current message is stuffed into the drafts or hit the read-later button now if you were typing at the time the message turned up you might randomly get either one of those when email comes in it beeeeeeps nothing you can do about that and then you have to hit ignore if you hit the hangup key you also close whatever else you were on if you get email notification it holds the screen lit even if the phone had locked the keys and gone blank before so if you don\\'t tell it not to bother you at night you are very likely to wake to a dead battery sometimes the navigation system starts itself for no apparent reason like when the phone is sitting on the coffee table and we are watching a movie\\n\\nthe phone comes with a poor set of ring tones my nokia e51 was much better and i think the sound quality was better too in general i think nokia are much better than lg\\n\\nthe web browser can be slow not the data connection that varies with signal quality and all else; at times the touch screen and the web page are slow to respond the tactile feedback shows that the \\'mouse\\' events have been ignored for long periods the widgets can be very hard to select too mostly it\\'s ok but on the low side of acceptable you wouldn\\'t want to try browsing normal web pages with anything less than this but it can be used\\n\\nanyway so what do you expect when you have a phone that\\'s smaller than an ipod but has a web interface and all else built in maybe just a bit more than i got a screen that can be read in direct sun and has better resolution would be a good start\\n\\n3 months later:\\n\\nthe gps especially in the \\'traffic based routing\\' mode is more of a novelty than anything else if it is all you have then it\\'s better than nothing but a basic $100 gps receiver is better than this recently i was making a side street diversion (home brewed not the phone\\'s idea) even when i was almost back on the main road no more than 200 yards from empty road it was still advising me to go back to where i got off i880 and sit in traffic for 30 minutes the garmin nuvi 680 is much better than this verizon should disable this supposed \\'feature\\' until their software people have done some serious rework\\n\\nthe work-flow around text messaging is poor new messages interrupt while you are entering a response picture messages take over completely when you are entering text other things should happen in background these phones have fantastically powerful little processors i can only suppose that the software guys know nothing about multi tasking and real time software (where i have 25 years experience) when you have read one text message and told it to you\\'ll read two or three interruptions later it drops you out of messaging instead of back to the in box to deal with the new messages sloppy\\n\\nreliability has been good though with a few crashes and still no software update an interesting strange behavior that has crept in each time i enter a $ sign in a message it enters $130000 but puts the cursor before the 1 it crashes if i try to group reply to email sometimes it just crashes not very often though so it\\'s not a show stopper for me\\n\\nwould i buy this phone today still yes the network coverage on verizon overrides the better bandwidth of the iphone if at&t had better coverage it might be a different answer if coverage doesn\\'t matter to you like you don\\'t leave metro areas then verizon doesn\\'t have any trump cards\\n\\nlate december: still no software update i\\'ve found a few more ways to crash the phone[] can do it any time hmm no that\\'s not true there is a software update and there has been one for some time i have v03 and v05 was out in september when i got the phone not great to find that out now\\n\\nmarch 09 update\\n\\nthe software update fixed most of the reliability issues and if i ever got round to complaining about questionable bluetooth performance well that was fixed too they have massaged the ui code and it has made the web abd keyboard interfaces easier to use a subtle but important improvement hard to quantify but very good\\n\\nthe gps guidance and especially the traffic avoidance are still not worth using unless you are really lost verizon\\'s navigation scheme is not a good solution if you need that sort of thing then buy a cheap gps',\n",

       " 'i have owned the e71x for over two years  i still have it and will probably use it until it dies this phone has one shining feature; it is as tough as nails i love the size features and durability of the e71x but all is not perfect in paradise  although this phone has a lot to love it has a lot of problems  so here is an idea of what is like to own the e71x\\n\\nthe things i don\\'t like about the e71x:\\n\\n1 the os:  nokia stopped supporting the symbian s60 3rd edition os almost immediately after they released it  there are lots of glitches with this os that need to be fixed via updates but nokia does not care  there are thousands of e71x users like me that have begged them to fix the problems with this os and we get no response the e71x hit the market about the time of the iphone and it did not get the huge reception that nokia wanted so the just abandoned it that really stinks and shows poor character for a large company like nokia\\n\\n2 app support:  if i were going to buy this phone again i would buy the e71 and not the e71x  the e71 and the e71x are identical except for the os  somehow even though they claim to have the same os (symbian s60 3rd edition) some apps that will go work on the e71 will not work on the e71x so there a lot fewer apps for the e71x  but what really irritates me is that of the few apps that are available for the e71x 9 out of 10 are not stand alone apps but require network data support to even start up  so if you are like me a person who thinks it is dumb to pay $60 a month for a data plan on a phone that has wifi then you will be ticked to find that most of the apps for the e71x require a data plan  i don\\'t mean that some of their feature will not work if you don\\'t have a data plan i mean that they will not even start up if they don\\'t find a data connection and just in case your are thinking of it; no they will not recognized a wifi connection so after two years of owning this phone i have only found a couple apps that will work on it without a data plan  i can tell you positively that they people that engineered the os for the e71x deliberately made it in a way so as to force you to buy a data plan  i paid top dollar to buy my phone so that i would not have pay for a data a plan that i would not use  it really really chaps me that at&t and nokia conspired together to do what they did\\n\\n3 battery life:  the battery life of the e71x is pretty bad  i seldom make it through a day without having to charge my phone the most i get out of it is a couple hours of talk time  i have bought new oem batteries for it but they die just as quick as the old ones  and just wait until you turn wifi on  oh my  you can literally watch the battery meter go down  i am not sure what kills the battery so fast because this phone has a relatively large battery pack compared to other phones i have used  for one thing there are no manual controls for screen brightness the e71x relies on a light sensor to adjust the the screen brightness but it has never worked on my e71x so my screen is always at it\\'s brightest  there is a slider control to adjust the sensitivities of the light sensor but adjusting it has no effect on my phone  lots of other people have complained about this to nokia but as i have said before nokia does not care  oh and the phone has a light breathing function when not in use that is impossible to turn off  basically the phone sits there and slowly lights up and slowly dims as if it is breathing so even when you are not using it it running the battery down\\n\\n4 wifi:  the wifi card on the e71x is pretty weak but it does work (for the 20 minutes you have battery life) the problem with it is really related to the os  the e71x has three idles screen themes (really should be called layouts) and on each of the three themes appears a link to your wifi function  so say you are sitting in a burger king and want to check if there is a wifi hotspot  you can quickly whip out your phone click on the wifi link and be scanning for a signal  great right well unfortunately that link causes your phone to crash three to four times a day in what is call the infamous \"idle screen theme error\"  the phone will crash sound an alarm and then give you the idle screen them error and then come back online  at first you don\\'t notice anything wrong with your idle screen theme until you try to use your wifi  that is when you notice that the wifi link is gone  you then spend the next three days trying figure out what has happened only to discover that you have once again been the victim of the glitchy symbian s60 3rd edition os and that nokia has no plans to fix the problem  now you are stuck with having to dig five menus deep into the phone settings to get to the wifi function or go through the process of resetting your idle screen theme several times a day\\n\\n5 gps:  the e71x does have a gps but it might as well not  it takes no less then 5 minutes for it to find satellite signal if you are standing dead still in the wide open but the really bad thing is that i have not been able to find a single stand alone app that will work with the gps that does not required a data plan if you have a data plan and are willing to stand out in the open for five minutes every time you want to use the gps i guess it might work for you but for me it is useless\\n\\n6 camera: the camera on the e71x is pretty bad when compared to other cameras of other smartphones with 32mp cameras  have even seen 2mp smartphone cameras that do better  i actually used a panel made up of some friends to judge the quality of two other smartphones (32mp & 2mp) against the e71x  the e71x lost hands down  i seldom use it as a result of the poor quality\\n\\nthe things i like about the e71x:\\n\\n1 size and durability:  the e71x is a brick it is really small for all the features it has and it is built more sturdier then any other smartphone i have held  this was the main reason i bought the e71x in the first place and it has not disappointed me in this regard i bought a slim anti-slip gel case for it when i first got it and it has been great  it has fallen a few times on concrete but the phone still looks and functions like it did when it was brand new\\n\\n2 keyboard & buttons:  i am a big man with fat fingers  at first i though i would have a problem with the small keyboard on the e71x but after a few days of break-in time i was typing away  like the rest of the phone the keyboard and the buttons feel solid and after two years of heavy use still look brand new  not one single letter or symbol is faded\\n\\n3 screen:  the screen is bright and sharp even if it is small (you can\\'t have everything)  i have used screen protectors from day one and it still looks great\\n\\n4 advanced voice calling support:  i hate holding a phone to my ear so i use a bluetooth 99% of the time  i also hate having to pull my phone out of my pocket and look through my address book (over 300 entries) to find a  number to call  but i don\\'t have to because the e71x has advance phone calling support i just have to push and hold the button on my plantronics voyager pro plus headset and speak the name of the person i want to call  wallah  that is as easy as it gets\\n\\n5 text to speech function:  the e71x has text to speech functions and will speak out the name of the person calling if they are in your address book  so say you are driving your car and your phone rings  it\\'s in your pocket and it is difficult to get it out to see who is calling  not a problem with the e71x  it rings and then says the name of the person (if they are in your address book)  if the call is from someone not in address book it just rings but this tells you that you don\\'t know the person that well and you can decide to let them leave a voicemail if you don\\'t want to take an anonymous call\\n\\n6 bluetooth:  unlike some phone that don\\'t like (or are software restricted from) transferring data with other bluetooth devices the e71x seems to be able to connect and transfer to any other bluetooth device that will talk to it  i like freedom and hate it when manufactures restrict their products to work only with in their engineered limitations (i am talking about you apple)\\n\\nwell that is about it  you should know all you need to know about the e71x now  if this phone had a better os (or at least better support from nokia) better camera better battery life and better apps support it would be a five star phone  that being said it is still pretty darn good phone for phone and texting functions and i would not shy away from buying another but never at full price again',\n",

       "\"i had the samsung v205 and then i decided to try the e715 out fyi to people with battery problems with these kind of batteries you must let it drain completely and then charge it kind of like building up your battery life and doing this a few times it will improve your battery life immensely i've been a t-mobile customer for a while now and i stay with them because: 1) they are now no 1 in customer service 2) great rate plans 3) it works great where i need it the most\\n\\nnow the additional features that the v205 didn't have that this little gadget has is:\\n\\n1) caller id pics although you won't be able to see it on the external display when you flip it open you'll see that person's face\\n\\n2) the camera now has a flash as well as a zoom and with that it is able to take pictures in gray (black and white) negative sepia and sketch also you can do multi-shot with this as well as put lots of different kind of frames to your pictures\\n\\n3)you can download games with the e715 whereas you cannot do so with the v205 furthermore the games are actually java with e715\\n\\n4) the flash can also serve as a flashlight which is quite useful sometimes when you don't know where you're walking and the light is pretty bright\\n\\n5) voice memo nuf said\\n\\notherwise it has the usual features it has an alarm calculator calendar to do list mms sms you can download ringtones (which is a big help since some of the ringtones sound pretty crappy) as well as games and pictures pretty much all the usual stuff is in this phone except you won't find bluetooth on this\\n\\nanother thing is that the external display is like a blue-green thing against a black background which is pretty cool since you won't have to press a button just to see the time it's always lit up so you can see it well also the pictures that you can take by lookin at the external display will be a bluish-green color but when it's saved and you look at it it's in full color so no worries there\\n\\noverall i have enjoyed this phone and no problems with it really another great thing is that it doesn't have an annoying external antenna to get in the way so it's a good buy\""
