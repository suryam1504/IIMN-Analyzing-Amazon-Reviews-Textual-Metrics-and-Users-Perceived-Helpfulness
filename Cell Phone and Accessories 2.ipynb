Second, I was kinda skeptical about purchasing it because it says that its for a Galaxy S and Blackberry so that can mean a lot of things! but I figured what the heck its cheap, so what can I loose!  Well, I just got it today and decided to give it a try at work on my Galaxy S4,  it charged  from 80%  to 100%  in about 7 minutes!! Yes i timed it!  and also the cord is long which is a plus for me!  So if your looking for a fast charger with a long cord and not to mention a great price, this is the one!!\\n\\nupdate:  not sure what the other reviewer meant by saying these are poor quality chargers, because I've had mine for a little over 2 weeks and it's still going strong!!  Love this charger  especially  for the length!!\",\n",

If they ever have anything is stock, it is cheap junk that does not last. I got this cord thru amazon for a fraction of the price I usually pay for the junk at that big national store. This cord works perfectly and has lasted for months now. I also bought at the same time 2 other cheaper charger cords thru amazon that work perfectly. Since this one still works, I have the other two to fall back on when this one finally goes out. This is a great car charger, and it does not cost near as much as the junk you get at the local store--not to mention this is the Samsung brand charger verses their junk.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"Love this! The HTC M9 is a beautiful phone, but I have a lot of issues with the battery lasting just for part of they day. When I am at the office I have it plugged in, so it is not an issue, but when I am off, like on the weekend and running around and not able to plug in, the battery is at 50% by noon. This battery extender is a life saver. In the past, I have used a power bank, which means I have to carry a cord to connect the power bank to my phone, so that is added inconvenience. Also, it is awkward to use my phone when it is plugged into the power bank. This here is a great alternative since I am able to (very easily) slide my phone into the case, making it feel like I am just carrying my phone, instead of three items. It is very light weight and adds a little length, but I don't find it an issue. I have used products similar like this in the past and this one is very slim compared to others, which where bulkier and heavier. I received a discount on this product in exchange for an honest review.\",\n",

It also adds bulk to the phone and makes it a bit taller, but still easy to use with one hand.  As far as charging goes, u can charge both the case and the phone @ the same time or just the phone while the case is connected. In my opinion after a couple days review, on a full charge, this case gives u about between 40-70% more battery. It drains rather quickly though. Also, there are 4 small blue indicator lights that flash when the case is charging the phone. They will remain on while it's charging, and only girl off when the case is dead or the case is not charging the phone. The end.\\n\\nUpdate: this case sucks. Returned it. ..the end\",\n",

It definitely is hefty and not made of some flimsy plastic. I figured I would give it a try for the charging aspect. And here are some of the things I don't like about it.\\n\\n1. When the phone is in the case and you plug the Lighting charger to the case to charge it. You have to press the button on the case or it would just charge the case but not the phone. No automatic phone charging priority.\\n2. It took some time for the case to charge the phone but this is my first charging case I have no comparison for this.\\n3. The speaker jack would only work with the skinny earphone jack. I use my phone for music to teach fitness class. The cable from the studios's stereo couldn't fit in the very deep and skinny hole on the case.\\n4. I don't normally use flashlight when I take pictures but when I did, the picture is just a blur of whatever the color of the phone case is, in my case, green.\\n5. IT IS huge and heavy! It doesn't fit in the wristlet I got so I had to get a bigger bag. I got a over the vent phone holder for the car that I loved and this is so heavy and big I had to constantly pushing it back so it doesn't fall out. I am hoping it didn't stretched out the tension hold of the holder!\\n\\nI am keeping it for the rare time I am going into the wildness as backup. Need to look for something slimmer for how I use and carry my phone.\",\n",

I had to carry a spare battery or charge cable.  With this battery, it lasts from when I get up until I go to bed (and still sitting at 30 to 40%.  I am a heavy phone user whether it be surfing the net, listening to streaming music or playing games.  This battery definitely works.\\n\\nNow the cons!  You are going to lose your waterproof safey.  The back cover they give you just snaps on so there is no gasket to protect the internal guts of your phone.  The outer cover is good with the non grip surface and it would probably protect fairly well with a small drop but it's not like having an otterbox on your phone.  It's significantly thicker than a standard battery as well.\\n\\nAll the extra battery is worth the extra thickness but just be careful around moisture!

If definitely makes the phone feel more substantial. Will update after a couple weeks. Bought this on sale for $40 with the much needed accessories, large battery and a two year warranty.

It's been a week and I have been charging it overnight. I have been doing  a lot of political phone canvassing recently, which covers a 3 hour block of time and averages 65 calls.\\n\\nWhile the battery drops when on for a few minutes, any subsequent drop in percent is extremely slow over the 3 hours, so from 99% to 90% over 3 to 3 3 1/2 hours is more in line with what I had expected originally. Overall the powerBear package is substantial as it includes a new, deeper-profile, S5 back cover, a rubberized back-cover protector and a front glass protector, with a cleaning cloth and USB charging cable.

With the battery capacity being already nearly 3x more than a NEW original S5 battery, it feels hardly thicker and it\\'s a great trade-off. It\\'s not the thinnest, obviously, but I\\'m really surprised it feels nice and not as bulky as I imagined.\\n\\nThe three pieces: the battery itself, the plastic battery cover piece (replaces your current back piece), and the optional rubbery-feel case part. My brother uses it without the case, so the back is smooth. He stopped using his previous case, since obviously it won\\'t fit over the new huge battery, so that\\'s one downside.\\n\\nWe haven\\'t calculated exact length it lasts, so I\\'m not going to give any technical info here,but as many times as he\\'s gone \"HA!

It\\'d also be cool if this came in a different colours, or came with a few different cases (since it makes it impossible to use other third-party cases).

I use my phone mostly for texting and web-browsing, some email, some Google Maps and Sky Maps, as a flashlight, a few non-intensive games; not a lot of phone calls. But with my old battery, same usage, I felt like I was doing pretty good if I still had 20% battery by the end of the work-day at 5ish.\\n\\nThe phone is now heavier, but not by a great deal. I tend to carry it in my front shirt pocket, which tends to cause my shirt to sag (but for me, function tends to outweigh form), but that was true of my old battery, too. It\\'s also a little thicker, too. So when I bought this battery, I also bought the case ($7-8-ish) that fits it, which I use some times, but I still tend to keep the phone in my shirt pocket a lot.\\n\\nWith the battery came a back cover (that does not have the NFC antenna in it, so NFC doesn\\'t work; I really like the NFC feature, but don\\'t find it easy/convenient/practical enough to use it enough to make its absence noticeable to me, at least so far), and a \"case\" that covers the back and sides of the phone. I was surprised to find that included; I guess I didn\\'t notice it in one of the product pictures, even though it\\'s there.\\n\\nIf this battery lasts, in good condition, for as much as a year, I will be completely sold on this product, and will likely remember the name \"PowerBear\" the next time I need a battery.\\n\\nI offered to buy one for my wife, but she doesn\\'t want to lose her cute pink case (for her, form tends to outweigh function - pfft). So while she wears out charging cables (and then taking mine - arg) fighting to keep her battery charged, I just go about my day, smug in knowing that I\\'m fine with whatever charge I have until I can manage to get to a charger later in the day, or maybe even tomorrow.',\n",

I'm not sure if it is the battery yet, or the age of the phone but it seems to lose contact with the phone every once in a while, which causes the phone to turn off. It got so bad that I had to go back to original battery (and that issue stopped right away). I'll give it another shot soon, but for now, I had to stop using this because I need a phone that stays on while I am in the middle of using it.... Will update again once I give it another shot, but for now, lowered from 4 stars to 2.\\n\\n----\\nOriginal Review:\\n\\nThis is a pretty good case with an extended battery for the Galaxy S5 phone. This case replaces the back cover of your phone, and replaces the original battery with a larger one. At first it seemed to be off and not working as far as the percentage indicator goes, but after several days of use, it was clear that the battery was definitely lasting a lot longer. I can pretty much go double the time that I used to with the original battery, and on power save mode, even longer (even though the remaining battery life estimate may not be accurate).\\n\\nMy only complaint is that the case part of the item doesn't provide much protection to the screen. If would be nice if it had a bigger lip over the edge of the phone.  Size-wise it is not too much bigger than the original phone (considering that the battery is double) and I think it actually makes it easier to hold the phone.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"This is a review of a few items I just bought. As they are all related and being used together Im going to paste the same review to each product.\\n\\nRecently my Samsung S5 has been draining badly as the OEM battery started to come to the end of its life. I started looking around for a replacement and decided to get an extended battery. I have been using a wireless charging pad and I wanted to continue to charge with this method as I have several pads and even a wireless charger for my truck. The charging receiver I have been using was not going to work with the extended battery so I opted for one that plugs into the bottom charge port of the phone. Im not crazy about removing the door from the bottom of the phone but I cant seem to find a way to get everything I want no matter how many products I buy.\\n\\nWhat I settled on was the PowerBear 7800 battery and the wireless receiver listed in the link below, unless this review is the one for that receiver. I got and installed the Powerbear battery and two back covers. I first installed the wireless receiver and then popped on the hard plastic back plate. I then tested to see if the phone would charge on my pad. It did, on two separate brands of pads without issue. I then added the protective soft rubber back cover and tested the phone on the pads again. To my surprise it started to charge with both cases on it.\\n\\nThe battery and case backs feel of high quality and I really like not only how the two back plates look but feel. The extended battery and both plates do not add that much weight to the phone and the cases do not make the phone very fat. I have been using a LifeProof case up until this point so Im used to a larger phone. This case gives me plenty to hold on to with my man hands and still can be stowed in a pocket with ease.\\n\\nTo make up for the lose of my Lifeproof case I also purchased a set of the Moko waterproof cases. They were really cheap and seem to be made well enough for my use. I wanted something that I could use on my boat and motorcycle. These fit the bill and the phone with both back plates fit in the case easily. I find that once you place your phone in the bag you can press the air out to get a vacuum seal. This makes using the phone much easier. This is also the same company that I bough 2 wireless charging phone holders for my vehicles. They work very well and are much better than constantly dealing with a charging cord.\\n\\nI have not had the battery long enough to speak to its power and life. If it fails me or does not deliver the powder advertised I will be sure to update that review.\\n\\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Rerii-Universal-Wireless-Charging-Micro-usb/dp/B00YGV76LK?ie=UTF8&psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00\\n\\nhttp://www.amazon.com/PowerBear-Samsung-7800mAh-Extended-Protective/dp/9707716371?ie=UTF8&psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00\\n\\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Universal-Waterproof-MoKo-Armband-Devices/dp/B01AJP3F7A?ie=UTF8&psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00\\n\\nUpdate: 11-5-16\\nI recently took a trip where I had a almost 3 hour plane ride. I was watching movies the entire flight and before while waiting to board. I had the screen on full. I didn't have to worry about my battery at all. It lasted all day and I still had plenty of juice when I was ready to settle in the hotel room.\\n\\nI have also been able to use my phone while the screen is on full while listening to Pandora and using GPS on my motorcycle. I have not even come close to running the battery down yet.\\n\\nWhen I get up in the morning I don't even have to think about a charger and I do whatever I want on my phone without any worries. On a typical day of use I will end the day with still about 70%. On a heavy day after watching a movie and having the screen on full I might be in the 30%s. I have to really try to get in much lower than that in a day.\\n\\nIt was a great by and a great battery for travel.\",\n",

Nice case.  I don't understand the reasons for the critical reviews, I have used extended batteries for years mostly the zero lemon, this battery is definitely an upgrade to the oem.  My s5 wouldn't get through a whole day of phone calls, Pandora, email, Facebook, and maybe a little Hulu streaming.  With ANY extended battery I have owned I can do all these things and still have 30% or more battery life at the end of the day.  Sometimes even go for 2 days!  Now if I don't do all those things and I'm in a good service area then the battery will last 3 days.  If you really don't notice any improvement over your OEM battery then either you got a lemon or something else is going on.  Wouldn't be surprised if the Zero lemon guys are leaving bad reviews because Powerbear's 2 year warranty is far beyond their 180 days.  Honestly Zero lemon feels like a cheap knockoff compared to my experience with the powerbear so far.\\nUpdate:  after using this for a month I can say it is not as long lasting as advertised.  The zero lemon lasted twice as long.  No other problems just not worth 5 stars.\",\n",

I had been using the ZeroLemon 8500 battery (after moving up from the 7500, but whatever) and the only issue that I had with that battery is that it was smothering the antenna on the phone quite badly.  I live where I do not have great service, it isn't that terrible but it's closer to an average 2 to maybe 3 bars typically and with that battery it would fight between 1 and 2 bars, and if it got covered by almost anything be it in my pocket or under a blanket, it (c/w)ould lose service altogether.  This battery doesn't seem to be giving me the same issues, so I am very happy with its performance so far.  One thing that needs to be said, and the only reason I didn't give it all 5 stars is because of the case.  I wouldn't trust it on my phone as far as I could throw it.  Which I am not going to try.  Because it would probably break.  I ended up rigging my phone into the ZeroLemon case with this battery and it works out pretty great.  No more signal issues!\",\n",

I can get 2-3 full charges from 10% minimum using this battery case.  I love it.\\n\\nUpdate:  I have had this almost 2 years and use it all day most every day.  This and another one.  I charge one battery case while using the other battery case and my phone NEVER goes dead.  I can do whatever I want on my phone, leave all my apps open, keep my phone bright as I want it, leave Bluetooth on, whatever.  These are a MUST have for me.  I like the battery case much better than an external battery and it offers some protection for my phone.  I put tempered glass screen protectors on the glass and pretty much covered.\\n\\nI highly recommend this case as it lasts about twice as long as the other because it's almost 5000 mah and my other one is a little over 2000.  I like that these come in the same color as my phone.  It also makes my phone easier to see and on the back of the phone it has a lever that allows me to stand my phone up horizontally or vertically.  This one takes about 2 hours to fully charge I think.\\n\\nBottom line: I love this case, it's lasted 2 years and works as well today as the day I got it.  Buy it now.

       "  'reviewText': 'I bought this for my 15 year old daughter who is taking a school trip to Mexico next month thinking it will probably come in handy since the battery on her 5C is doing good if it lasts for 8 hours.  It arrived quickly and I was definitely impressed with the build quality for the price. Her phone fit nice and snug and there was a positive click when it reached the plug on the bottom of the case. The top part of the case was a perfect fit as well and it snaps shut with a very firm grip on the phone, but it does seem like it will be a bit of a struggle to remove it.  For those that will leave it on their phone all of the time this is a moot point of course.  She plans on testing it this weekend to see how long the battery will last and trust me, she is a very heavy user. The 4200 mAh rating seems to be a bit of a stretch and in theory it should last almost 3 times longer the phone battery which I believe is rated at 1,507mAh.  I will update this review when I hear back from her and then again after her trip.  Oh yeah...she loves the shade of pink I got her.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"** Updated **\\nIt's been little over 7 months now and it's still strong and I still love it!  Very similar strength as when I first got it.  I can definitely go through a full day without worrying about the battery.  With average use and not much of game play, I can still almost go for 2 days with this battery.\\n===================\\n** Updated **\\nIt's been about 100 days now since I used this battery and it's strong going strong.  I never have to worry about running out of battery within a day and it almost gets me through 2 days even now.\\n===================\\nBased on my 4 days of this battery, I am very satisfied with this product as of now.  I just hope this continues to be the case after 6 months or even a year.  Normally I would only have about 20 or 30 percent of battery left when I get back from work, but now I have about 75% left. I no longer have to worry about running out of battery for those days when I have to use the phone more than usual.  I hadn't dropped my phone, so I am not sure how well the case will protect, but it looks like the foam-feeling cover would protect the back and sides and since front side of the case comes up above the phone's face, it should protect.  I am use to bit of rubbery type of case. This case doesn't give as much as friction and grip that the rubbery type of case gives, but gives enough so that it's not slippery at all.  The back hexagon pattern makes it look like women's case.  I wish it didn't have any pattern.  But then maybe this pattern is added to help with not slipping.  It is much thicker with extended battery cover and case than with regular cover.  But not thick enough to bother me or carrying it in my jean pocket.\",\n",

Well it is a rubberized hard case like all the others she has gotten.  It does fit nice and seems well made.  Time will tell if the design holds up.  Upon reviewing the item details I see that it is listed as rubberized (kids don't take the time to read do they?)

I saw this and usually I had to charge my old battery 3 or 4 times a day and with this one I can go 2 days without charging the phone after a full nights charge and that makes it very nice.  I use my phone a lot especially outside work so it is nice to be able to look at my battery life after a full days work and still see 90%+.  Even if I use the phone almost all day the battery still has life at the end of the day.  The screen protector that came with this phone battery and case fit perfect and was really easy to put on without any issues and doesnt cover anything like the speaker or mic.\\nI received this at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and true review. I have never spoken to the company and they have never contacting me or told me what to say on the review.',\n",

The biggest problem is the phone won\\'t ring when the headset is in \"connected\" mode.  It will just vibrate.  If you keep in in \"disconnected\" mode it takes 10-20 seconds to connect so better hope whoever is calling you waits a long time after you pick up (and there is no sound) and it doesn\\'t go to voicemail.  Jabra tech support at first claimed it was a feature - \"thats the way all headsets work\" - yeah right! His suggestion was a) wear the headset all day long (you can hear the ringing thru the headset) b) keep the phone in your pocket all the time so you feel the vibration.  Then when pushed he claimed they are working on fixes.  It irks me that I bought this because [it is] listed ... as compatible, ...\\nThe other weakness is that the little eargel falls off very easily in your pocket or if it hits something, so its a pain not to lose it.  Otherwise it is comfortable and the sound quality is pretty decent on speaker and microphone.\\nLook at other headsets ...\\nthanks,\\nLon',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'This is my first phone since owning an Ericsson RX280L, and I had gotten used to unlimited Internet access and long battery life as necessary features for a phone and service.  The Nokia 3650 will browse the Web, and the battery is fairly long-lived.  On those counts, this is a perfectly acceptable upgrade.  However, when you rate it on its own merits, there are some points to consider.\\nOne, it uses MMC flash for storage.  MMC isn\\'t exactly the most popular format -- Secure Digital (SD) would have been a far better choice -- and so comparable capacities cost more for MMC than SD flash.  What I find disappointing about the MMC choice is that offering MMC *and* SD isn\\'t very difficult in itself.  In fact, Lexar sells the Trio which handles Sony Memory Sticks, SD, and MMC quite nicely and compactly.  Minor point, perhaps, but consider your current flash memory investments before buying the phone.\\nI love the camera.  Good snapshots, neat little movies that pick up sound, and even a sound recorder.  So the added utility of the phone is very attractive, making the flash memory issue a little more than minor (imagine owning five SD cards and realizing none of them work in this phone).\\nThe Symbian OS is a dog.  It\\'s a slow dog, that annoys me to no end.  The bootup time for this is comparable to Windows 3.1.  Really!  A PocketPC or Palm device, by comparison, has no boot time (well, the Palm OS has no boot time, PocketPC negligible for warm boot).  I\\'m not a big fan of this OS, or its abilities.\\nNav of settings, utilities, etc. is a little complex.  There\\'s a handful of ways to get at phone settings, for example, and there\\'s probably a million little shortcuts you can use... and would probably not want to memorize.  Programmable front buttons let you choose oft-used apps (Camera and Bluetooth, for example) and it supports one-touch dialing... well, one-key plus the green \"ON-Go-Dial\" circle.\\nSIM card support; store numbers on your SIM or the MMC card or the phone memory.  Seasoned travelers would likely store numbers on the SIM.  Onto Bluetooth and synchronizing.\\nNokia\\'s PC Suite is powerful, if you can get it to work.  Setting up your PC to use a Bluetooth stack isn\\'t trivial (lookup Jon\\'s \"Definitive Blueeooth Guide\" for the best help; also geekzone.co.nz).  When it does work, it\\'s wonderful.  Pull off images, upload WAVs to use as ringtones, save all settings for backup, synchronize Outlook contacts and calendar to the phone, superb utility if you get it to go.\\nAll this leads me to a solid conclusion: the Treo 600 kicks its butt.  PalmOS, SD card support, most mature synchronization utility available.  Aside from the cool camera functionality, this phone is not the best you can buy, leading me to believe that the true future of mid- and high-end phones, as well as PDAs of the same class, to be full convergence of the two.  And so with that in mind, get this phone if it\\'s free with a new contract... then wait for smartphone prices to drop.\\nFred',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I bought this phone a few days ago, and it is awesome!\\nOut of the box, it is pretty cool(...)!\\nCool Features: Bluetooth, MMC Card [16MB included- but upgradable], large screen, plays any MIDI you can drop into it, IR connectivity.\\nTONs of software: It runs Symbian OS, so there are lots of programs/games to install.  I have installed 'Active Desk' [a replacement desktop/theme organizer] and AgileMessenger [supports MSN, Yahoo, AOL, ICQ and other IMs] along with 'Extended Profiles' [lets you custimize when differnet profiles come on, or how long they last + more].  Check the Yahoo groups for 3650- there are several of them with lots of good backgrounds, games, ringtones, etc.  There are replacement web browsers [Opera, NetFront], screen savers, IR Remote software, and even a Gameboy emulator [haven't tried this one yet].  Hell, there are even movies you can download and watch on the unit [once you get a larger MMC card].\\nNegative Features: Bad battery life when usign Bluetooth & IR excessivly, strange keypad layout [you get used to it], bluetooth learning curve, slow 'boot-up' [about 30 seconds].\\nI have this connected via Bluetooth to my PC [with a few headaches setting it up] but I have been having problems connecting to my TG50 clie [need special drivers from the internet].\\nSo, at this point, I can check my e-mail, browse the web, chat on MSN or Yahoo! messenger [hard to do with the keypad- predicive input helps] and go anywhere in the US that T-Moblie has coverage [or most cities and interstates that have GSM 1900Mhz].\\nIf you like gadgets that you can tie into your computer, palm, car, etc. then this is the phone for you!\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I purchased the Cellular Innovations because I have used them for about six years with my other track and Boost mobile phones and received great reception.  When  I would remove the booster from my phone my calls would not go through as well when I would be in buildings, basement, under bridges or other poor reception areas. I rarely have call drops and the reception is smooth and clear. I can get a call through when other people have to look for a clear signal. I noticed that with my new Boost Mobile android phone without it the reception was good but with it the service was great. I have purchased several for family and friends over the years and they enjoy the clear reception too. It is important that you handle the antenna with care; put the booster in your phone with clean hands; and must be careful in placing it in the correct location as instructed to get the  best reception. It works best if you don't touch the antenna with your fingers, Hold it by the sides or edge; smooth it with a smooth flat card. I use my small library tag. If you put the antenna  into your phone incorrectly it will not work. I like to keep one on hand for a back-up to make changes after about six or seven months of use.  It also makes a nice gift to put into cards for that extra special touch.  The booster is a must have for less expensive phones and a big help for my android phone. I get the best of both worlds, low phone fees, and great reception with the Cellular Innovation antenna. Thanks\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'The band itself is quite attractive and feels great. They clearly made an effort on packaging (nice box), rather elaborate for what is only a 2 piece band. OK, that\\'s fine even though I\\'d prefer less wrapping efforts and a lower price. I took it out an realized that it\\'s really soft, comfortable, and far more preferable than the black leather band that came with my black watch. I was impressed at how it looks and feels better than the usual junk you\\'ll find here that is imported.\\n\\nA negative seemed to be that the watch band is long - really long. It\\'s longer than the stock leather band. But it turned out that the buckle is a bit on the side and the end strap can be \"bolted\" into place on the other side. This leaves you with the ability to rest your hand straight down without feeling the buckle pressing in on the underside of your wrist. Turns into another pro for most people. I have average sized mens wrists.\\n\\nPro - the new system of opening the pin latch and inserting the band is awesome. Took me 2 minutes to replace the band and done.\\n\\nCon - This one is unfortunate. Look at the band. The black watch can be classic. Look at the Moto version with its own black metal band. Looks very elegant - surprisingly so. The stock leather band also has completely black buckles and straps holders. Blends in without being obtrusive. Unfortunately Tylt didn\\'t see fit to cover the very shiny silver buckle and end bolt the same black color. As a result, what looks like a very sharp and somewhat sporty silicon band looks more like the stock plastic bands you\\'ll find on digital watches like Casio, Timex, etc. And since the buckle is so high up, don\\'t expect to put a classy watch face on the top and have it be mistaken for anything else with the silver buckles present. I hope they take this into consideration for what is an otherwise great watch band that I think justifies a more premium price.',\n",

After reading the size dementions between this (3000) and the 2000 I went with this one, I wanted to keep my ipod 4g with otterbox defender safe inside and eventually an iphone with either a defender or armor case. So i compared the sizes and ended up with this 1. First, at least the clear version of this box is way bigger then u would expect, it dwarfs my little ipod in there, but leaves plenty of room for wallet/anything else. It is much to big for a pocket or anything like that, but would easily fit in a backpack and comfortibly fits in your hand when u carry it.  In conclusion, if u want the extra space, get this 1, if not and you want just your phone/other small items, get the 2000. Note: (will fit an iphone 3-4-5  with pretty much any case on it and still have plenty of room for wallet/anything else)',\n",

While Pelican is the gold standard for the larger cases, only the OtterBox cases have the quality I expected in this size. The plastic seems to be more resistant to scratching and cracking, the bottom and top of the case actually 'seal' together, and the top and bottom are both padded to protect the contents from shock, whereas the pelican case only has rubber padding on the bottom half. The hinge opens to slightly over 180 degrees, but it is loose, so where you can open the Pelican lid half way and it will stay, the lid on this case will fall to either full open or full closed. The latches are a little tighter than the pelican case, especially to open, which is a good thing. The protrusions on the top and bottom do not stack. The lanyard, while it hasn't broken yet, seems like the first part that will fail. All in all, this seems to be a rugged storage and organizational tool.\",\n",

FYI to people with battery problems, with these kind of batteries, you must let it drain completely and then charge it.. kind of like building up your battery life and doing this a few times, it will improve your battery life immensely. I've been a T-Mobile customer for a while now and I stay with them because: 1) They are now no. 1 in customer service, 2) Great rate plans, 3) It works great where I need it the most!\\n\\nNow the additional features that the V205 didn't have that this little gadget has is:\\n\\n1) Caller ID pics.. although you won't be able to see it on the external display, when you flip it open, you'll see that person's face.\\n\\n2) The camera now has a flash as well as a zoom. And with that, it is able to take pictures in gray (black and white), negative, sepia, and sketch. Also, you can do multi-shot with this as well as put lots of different kind of frames to your pictures.\\n\\n3)You can download games with the E715 whereas you cannot do so with the v205. Furthermore, the games are actually java with E715\\n\\n4) The flash can also serve as a flashlight. Which is quite useful sometimes when you don't know where you're walking and the light is pretty bright.\\n\\n5) Voice memo.. nuf said\\n\\nOtherwise, it has the usual features. It has an alarm, calculator, calendar, to do list, MMS, SMS, you can download ringtones (which is a big help since some of the ringtones sound pretty crappy), as well as games and pictures. Pretty much all the usual stuff is in this phone.. except you won't find bluetooth on this.\\n\\nAnother thing is that the external display is like a blue-green thing against a black background.. which is pretty cool since you won't have to press a button just to see the time... it's always lit up so you can see it well. Also, the pictures that you can take by lookin at the external display will be a bluish-green color but when it's saved, and you look at it, it's in full color so no worries there.\\n\\nOverall, I have enjoyed this phone and no problems with it really. Another great thing is that it doesn't have an annoying external antenna to get in the way so it's a good buy.\",\n",

The battery life is the worst of any phone I\\'ve ever owned. It MAY last 2 to 3 days in stand by IF I don\\'t use it at all; if I use the phone at all, even just 10 minutes, no more than one day on a full charge. 2. No voice activated dialing. I like to use a speaker type hands free kit in the car so I don\\'t have to look at the phone to answer, talk or dial. I think all phones should have it. 3. It is not very user friendly. The menus are not logical and are confusing. 4. It has an IR but it doesn\\'t sync with your computer. You can\\'t transfer anything. I don\\'t get why they even have it. They have software and cable you can purchase that will let you backup the phone numbers you enter and photos you take, but (5) no syncing with Outlook, your PDA or anything else. 6. If you buy ring tones or wallpaper, you can\\'t back those up.\\nI do love the phone for its size, weight and even the color, I find it easy to hold and talk with. The sound isn\\'t the best, but it isn\\'t bad either. It rings nice and loud and putting it on vibrate is easy. I can\\'t put the phone in a standard cell phone holder for the car because the camera button is on the side and it\\'s a long key, the holder makes the camera come on. I had to get a small holder that only grabs in one small area on each side. I\\'ve had to purchased 3 additional batteries and every kind of charger available because the average use of a battery is 15 hours (regular phone use for me is: about 10 minutes a day, use the \"t-zones\" for a minute or two once a month, in 6 months I\\'ve taken a total of 9 photos, and transferred data twice). The battery lasted 3 days ONCE, when I was home sick and didn\\'t use the phone and one 24 hour day I had to replace the battery three times as they completely discharged. I\\'m use to a battery lasting 5 to 8 days (like this phone says it will last).\\nI also like T-Mobile. Their customer service is really good, the features they offer on their web site are great, the prices for wireless modem and wireless web are incredibility great and the national calling price plans are very good compared to what I?ve seen elsewhere. I was with AT&T since they bought out L.A. Cellular. The customer service was great for years, but got so bad I?d wait on hold for hours and couldn?t get through to a person for days.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"The last year or so we have all seen an explosion of nice color phones in the market.  Most of their functionalities are the similar while some have the extra bonus bells and whistles while really sells the product.  Like many others, I was attracted to this phone because of the nice styling, the size, and the camera.  I have previously owned a Samsung S105, which was a nice phone as well so it was easy for me to learn this phone since many menu functions were similar.\\nThe first and foremost thing I look for in a phone is the sound quality.  The sound quality of the phone is not bad.  Having owned the Nokia 6610 as well I would say the Nokia phone sounds a little better but this might be because I am used to the 6610.  I am sure most people will be happy with the sound quality of the E715.\\nThe next thing is reception.  Unlike the older Samsung phones this phone uses an internal antenna which works good, if not better than phones with antennas.\\nThe camera on this phone is quite nice.  There is a flash and a zoom feature which is added bonus.  The 640x480 pictures taken by this phone is OK to be viewed by cell phones' smaller screens but if you view the pictures on your computer you might be disappointed.\\nThis phone does have a 40 chord Midi capability which means you can download some good songs.  For the tech savvy there is a program called Easy GPRS which can be downloaded from Samsung's European website. This program will allow you sync up your phone with your pc.  The other program which I like is called PSM Play which allows you to edit midi files and convert them into mmf. files.\\nOne useful feature which this phone does not have is speaker phone.  Generally I don't like to hold the phone next to my ear, or use the ear pieces.  The speaker phone on the Nokia is great for this purpose.\\nAnother minor inconvinence with this phone is the phone's IrDa capability with your PC.  As I have mentioned already you will need to download an application from Samsung Europe in order to transfer data from your PC to your Phone.  With some other phones such as the Sony Ericcson T610 you can simply transfer files through Window's default program when you match your phone's infra red port with your laptop's.  Of course EasyGPRS also have the ability to do many other things but sometimes I wish that I can transfer simple images/sounds directly using just windows.\\nFinally, the battery on this phone runs out a little faster than some other phones.  If you play around with this phone often the battery will run out in a day.  If you don't it will last 2-3 days.\\nCurrently this is not the best cell phone on the market but this is definitely one of the best Tmobile GSM phones at the moment.  With rebates this phone will only cost $50 which is well worth the price of cancelling your old account and starting up a new one.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'I have had to replace our office Treos --- in one case three times and twice in another, as the speaker (ear piece) fails. Lack of voicedial and a tinny speakerphone are problems. Digital only service works fine in major metropolitan areas but is problematical when one travels to more \"rural\" parts of the US. The camera is extraneous and is worthless even when adjusted with software (after-market). Keyboard is great for email but the lack of Graffiti is irritating for us original Palm users.\\n\\n Traded mine for a Samsung i500 and am much happier except for the lack of after-market add-ons or lack of stock. Samsung is tri-band so this is great for additional use in other areas where there is no PCS service. Samsung has voicedial and speed dials that exceed that of the Treo and I like that better. Size of Samsung i500 is much smaller and fits in my pocket easier, as I an not a man with large pockets. The fact that I can not play MP3s due to the limited memory of the Samsung vs. the Treo is not an issue as I have an Ipod. Ripping MP3s and slow load make the Treo not a great music player.\\n\\n 16mb of memory is more than sufficient for most, I never filled the Treo to the 32mb capacity except I used the memory card for books. Suggest that if you don\\'t need to carry a lot of data, go for the Samsung as it is more reliable, has two batteries (7 hours vs. my continually charging the Treo from a short to moderate conversation).\\n\\n Both are about the same price, so be cool and be one of the few who have a Samsung 1500 vs. the Treo. Samsung and Sanyos do have the best voice and sound for cell. I have a pre-paid unlocked SonyEriccson 610 with T-Mobile and that is fine for overseas or a cute but hard to use (joysticks are for the birds) phone. Ironically, I got the SonyEriccson as a trade for a free MS Smartphone that always crashed, locked and never worked right.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"To be frank, I had high expectations for the Treo 600, after reading so much about it in the time leading up to its release.  On actual use, I have been quite disappointed.  Still, let me say up front that it deserves three stars for being a usable, pocketable smart phone.\\nMy biggest gripe lies with the keyboard, which is too small and too minimalistic.  It's very easy to press two keys at the same time, so whatever Handspring said about this being the best designed thumboard ever, don't believe it.  The keys have a round surface, which hurts your fingers after a typing a little while.  But the biggest problem again is the spacing of the keys, which are just too small and too close together.\\nAlso, there are no dedicated number keys, which is extremely annoying.  To add more woes to this limitation, you cannot num-lock the numeric keys, so you always have to hold down the number shift key to type in numbers.  Someone clearly wasn't thinking straight when they put this together.  Get this: it's easier to type in accented letters (which aren't used in English) than punctuations.  That is just plain silly.\\nThe screen is also too small, and the viewing angle isn't too good, which means unless you look at it straight on, you will have a hard time seeing what's on the screen.  Compared to the silk-smooth screens on the Tungsten and Clie, this one feels crude and pixelated.\\nNow, if you plan to use the Treo 600 for web surfing, be prepared to be really disappointed.  The internet speed is just plain pathetic.  Loading Amazon.com's home page took over 3 minutes, and it's barely readable because the layout is all screwed up.  Loading MSN's home page took even longer, although the pictures did come across nicely.  For some reason I've not been able to open Apple's homepage at all.  No error messages, just no page, either.  MSNBC works fine, so does Yahoo and Sprint PCS's own home page (good thing, there!).\\nIn short, I'm pretty disappointed with the implementation.  A new model, the Treo 610, is rumored to come out soon, with a better screen and improved battery life -- but probably still the same slow Internet speed, which is more a problem with the 2.5G network than the Treo hardware per se.  Anyway, unless you have lots of money to throw away and don't feel like giving it charity, I recommend you wait for the next generation of Treo.\",\n",

I moved over to the NEXTEL phone service for my next phone, which was the MOTOROLA i1000 and a couple of years later I bought the i90, which was the phone I have been using until I recently upgraded to the i730.  I have been with NEXTEL for the last 5 years and I am completely satisfied with their professionalism and outstanding service.  The trade-in/buy-back program is wonderful and it definitely the best way to upgrade your phone.  NOW........on to the i730.......WOW..........what an awesome phone!!!!!!!!!  I can't begin to tell you that NEXTEL offers the best MOTOROLA phones then any other carrier.  I have looked at other phones from other carriers and none compare to the i730.  If this is your 1st MOTOROLA phone purchase, you are in for a real treat.  The instructions are well-documented and it doesn't take rocket-science to navigate through the i730 software.  The biggest treat for me is the COLOR screen, the sleek-ness of the phone and it's overall aesthetic beauty.  So if want to be the envy of all your friends, please do yourself a favor and pick up this phone.  Also, once you experience the NEXTEL service, it will definitely be your last and only phone carrier.

For emergencies, I remedied this with a tracfone(.com) and just buy a 1 year card each year.\\nNow, for the phone....It\\'s got close to as sensitive reception as my old i1000 plus, which had AWESOME reception. The speakerphone on this model is EXCELLENT, definitely an improvement over the other Nextel models. Battery life is STILL on the \"fairly horrible\" end of things...charge it every night or you\\'ll run out in the middle of your workday on the 2nd day, especially if you use data features a lot like I do. Luckily, recharge time is VERY quick (under 2 hours with mine) with included rapid charger.\\nAs a delivery driver in Michigan, I\\'m out in all types of weather, no problems yet with this phone, but I wouldn\\'t suggest using in a downpour!

A non-reflective coating would have been nice on the display. Very useful 600 entry contact list, which can store ALL of a contact\\'s info (home#, work#, cell#, fax#, email, etc.) Phone has a handy notepad and will take vocal notes, also.

The little disco light is kind of funny, too (almost a disco party in your pocket!).\\nInterface is maddening to get used to, if only because it\\'s similar enough to the i1000+ (which I had for three years) that it can get confusing, as it\\'s not the same. Color display is sharp. All volume levels can be set from whisper quiet to LOUD LOUD!\\nMinor gripe: waaay too easy to hit the direct connect button in its holster...make sure you\\'ve switched \"one touch direct connect\" OFF if you\\'re moving around a lot, and once you\\'ve finished using DC, hit the STOP button (on top in the middle) to get it back to phone-mode, or you\\'ll have to be apologizing all the time for accidentally two-waying somebody!\\nEXTREMELY handy is the \"profiles\", which allow individual volume, behavior and wallpaper settings for different situations, i.e., \"Truck\" \"Work\" \"Meeting\" \"Movie\" or what have you.\\nAll in all, a very good phone, especially with all the customization you\\'re able to do with the feature settings.\\nADDENDUM: another minor gripe: the \"stop\" button in the center top position of the phone is too easy to bump when removing the phone from its holster-I\\'ve accidentally ended several incoming calls this way.\\n**********NOTE: instead of always buying a new car charger for your latest, greatest cell phone and adapters for your newest laptop, simply buy a power inverter which plugs straight into your vehicle\\'s cigarette lighter. Make sure it has a built-in surge protector. Voila! Vehicular power utilizing your \"home\" charger (cell) or plug (laptop). The best plug directly into the cigarette lighter socket without a cord (the units can get hot, a cord can allow the unit to move all over in the car.)

Now they just line their pockets and forget about the little things about the customer.\\n\\nGranted I have found AT&T to be better than Sprint/Nextel (so glad I'm not with them anymore).\\n\\nPorted my number - Had no problems porting my number over from Nextel, The people that I have spoken to on the phone with AT&T so far have been quite nice and easy to understand for the most part (even the ones with accents you can understand well), I find this a great plus. Several times when calling up Nextel I'd get someone who bairly spoke english and wouldn't get the hint that I needed to talk to someone that spoke better english so I could get the help I needed.\\n\\nHOLD TIMES - AT&T so far has had some pretty low hold times , also they don't don't charge you for calling them for support like several others do. Nextel counts it against your minutes to call them to get things resolved and so on.\\n\\nFast useage checking! - all you do is call a specific number as to what you want to check, say like minutes you dial *646# and you get a free text message right to your phone that tells you how many minutes you have left. Same thing goes for balance, Data use (phones with internet access). There is one for payments as well, I haven't used that one yet but it's supposed to take you to a way to do in via an automated system or something like that.\\n\\nPretty much I've been quite pleased with the service I've gotten so far, but I still think the plans are over priced. If it wouldn't have been for the fact that I get a nice discount through the company I work for I wouldn't have gotten the plan. It drops the price I pay to a somewhat acceptable rate.\",\n",

Now I can\\'t imagine living without it!\\n\\nSome of the other reviewers don\\'t seem to understand what they bought.  They ordered a wireless plan on Amazon and didn\\'t realize that it came with a Regulatory Cost Recovery Fee.  Then they were asked to write a review before they even realized what they got.\\n\\nBut a little experience shows that this Regulatory Cost Recovery Fee is a marvel of innovation that is packed with value!\\n\\nThink about it.  There was a time when phone companies were much more heavily regulated.  Then congress passed lots of new laws to change phone company regulation and allow more competition.  These laws are extremely complicated, and the congressmen needed help writing them.  So, the phone companies came to the rescue with teams of lobbyists to help write the new laws!\\n\\nThe problem was that those lobbyists were extremely expensive. To make matters worse, the phone companies knew that if they didn\\'t get everything they wanted, they\\'d have to hire even more expensive lawyers to fight the laws.  So in exchange for agreeing to deregulation, they invented the beautifully-named Regulatory Cost Recovery Fee.  Hurray!\\n\\nThis wonderful invention allows the phone companies to charge an extra fee over-and-above the rates that they are allowed to charge for their services, so that they can fund the very expensive effort of fighting the other parts of the laws that they don\\'t like!  They can make the fee any amount they want, because it doesn\\'t actually go to any government or regulatory body.  It just goes straight to the phone company so they can hire more lawyers.  With high-powered Washington lawyer/lobbyists charging $400 an hour, you can imagine how hard it would be to survive without these great fees!\\n\\nWhat\\'s even more brilliant is the name.  \"Regulatory Cost Recovery Fee\" is one of the greatest product names ever.  It just screams out \"I\\'m official.\"  It sounds so much like a tax, people actually believe that it is one, and it sounds so official, nobody questions the exact amount.\\n\\nIn summary, this is one brilliant product that\\'s packed with value.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"When I initially reviewed this phone, I gave it glowing endorsements based upon a unit that met specifications.  Unfortunately, after acquiring a few other units I have come to the conclusion that many critics have been correct.  While I still think this is a decent phone, it appears to have been plagued with inconsistent manufacturing standards, slightly cheaper components, and higher failure rates than other Sanyo models.\\n\\nThe Sanyo 8200 is a solid phone that will be far superior to many alternatives. Not to mention, with the deals you get for signing a 2 year agreement, this phone can be a great value. Sanyo added a few extra nice features for this phone like an alarm (yippie!!!) and appointment calendar. But overall, the features are only slightly above average compared with the current generation of phones. Let's face it, some of these newer phones have really raised our expectations.\\n\\nThe phone camera is not top-end but decent for daytime use. Of course the speakerphone quality is high quality as usual with Sanyo phones.\\n\\nThe signal strength isn't as good as the 4900 or the 8300.  I suspect they cut corners on the antenna. If you are a person that demands 5 bars in every location, get the 8300 instead. In addition, the MM7500 and the 9000 will probably both offer stronger antennae with their superior next gen features.  While the reception sounds fine, this phone averages 2-3 bars.\\n\\nThe screen resolution is also good but not fantastic. The memo recorder could have used much more memory.\\n\\nSprint coverage is better than advertised as long as you use a good phone. Customer service is not as great as it used to be, but it's still better than Verizon.  I'm switching friends off of Verizon to Sprint. Believe me, if you have bad reception, you have a bad phone and it's time to use that warrantee. With this phone, I've had to go back to the Sprint store countless times to get them to swap it out.\\n\\nSeveral reviewers have stated they have problems with sounding garbled during conversations. Most likely, this is another case where you need to utilize that warranty or return policy. When the phone is good, it's good. If you're having problems, you probably have one of the 30% of these phones that comes off the manufacturing line with hardware issues. They might not give you another model, but they definitely have to replace the phone.\\n\\nAlso, be mindful of the firmware version of this phone.  Even replacement versions are shipping at rev 25.  You should go to the store to update your phone to rev 29 or better.\\n\\nOne thing that is a big disappointment is the lack of accessories that come standard with this phone. Not to mention, when are manufacturers going to make a data cable standard?\\n\\nUnfortunately these criticisms apply to all phones. Sanyo has added some nice features to this model. Even with its flaws, it's a decent deal for the price. If you can afford the next generation, however, I would recommend it.  Best wishes!\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"The last PCS cell phone I owned was the venerable SCP-8100 from Sanyo.  It was a cute little phone that was the second cell phone from any U.S. carrier that could take pictures.  (The first-ever model was the SCP-5300 also from Sanyo, released in July 2002.)  The PM-8200 addressed two shortcoming of the 8100: 1) camera quality, and 2) speakerphone.\\nThe 8200 sports a higher-resolution built-in camera.  Picture quality is also improved.  The old 8100's pictures often had streaks and distorted colors.  The 8200's pictures look much better.  The speakerphone is definitely a great addition for those of us who like to multi-task yet dislike headsets.  The volume and clarity could be a little better, but given the compact size of this phone, it's not bad.\\nReception on the 8200 is great, thanks to its external antenna.  Battery life is good, unless you save a lot of things in memory, which depletes battery faster the more stuff it holds.  The phone is attractive and can be customized in many ways, not to mention it comes in three colors.  To Sanyo, I suggest you use the iPod Mini color scheme, because not many people like big red!\\nIn summary, the 8200 delivers lots of improvements over the already-excellent 8100.  If you have Sprint or plan to get Sprint, this is the phone.  If you want video recording, check out the Toshiba phone for Sprint.\",\n",

I have called customer support 3 times with issues. The problems got fixed each time. The online FAQ page is useless and the company says (online and while you are waiting on the phone for customer support) that email is the quickest option. Jabra says they answer your email within 1-2 hours. That hasn't happened for me yet. The first email never got answered and the second got answered a day later without an response to my actual question. Even the technician on the phone said they have difficulties interpreting email questions. They have very courteous and knowledgable technical assistance reps on the phones.\\n\\nI like the headset. It has good reception, sync's well,comfortable, very long charge(holds longer than my phone, and has easy to press buttons.

       "  'reviewText': 'I picked up this headset the other day and I\\'m relatively pleased with it. Despite a few bad reviews, the sound quality is acceptable for making telephone calls and dicatation, though the sampling rate is obviously too low to listen to music with it. I easily paired it with a Sony-Ericsson t68i and my 15\" Powerbook running Mac OS X 10.3.8.\\n\\nMy quick testing with iChat AV was positive and it seems quite usable for use with an iSight for the voice portion of a call. I also was able to set the sound output to the headset and am currently listening to some music with it, but the low sample rate and the fact that it isn\\'t in stereo makes this only a novelty. Nevertheless, it is still useful when a real pair of headphones are not available.\\n\\nThe range, as mentioned in other reviews, isn\\'t amazing, but was sufficient to move about an average-sized room and worked intermittently through a cinder block wall.\\n\\nIt fit fairly comfortably on my ear and seems to easily hide, though is a bit cumbersome to put on at first. The multiple earpieces are also a plus. The dual charger/belt clip is an interesting idea, but seems to be poorly executed. It seems somewhat unstable, so I\\'m not sure I\\'d actually keep it on my belt. However, it might not be bad for riding around clipped to something inside of my backpack.\\n\\nAll in all, it\\'s not a bad device, though there is certainly some room for improvement.

       "  'reviewText': 'The Pros:\\n\\nThe function and design of this headset are first rate. Right out of the box it was easy to pair with my Motorola v505 phone.\\n\\nIt is small and unobtrusive\\n\\nThe battery life is really good in standby mode, and lasts several hours of talking. (and it does issue warning tones when the battery runs low, plus the phone issues a message saying \"headset signal weak - switch to handset?\"\\n\\nThe combo belt clip/charger is a really cool idea.  It would have been EVEN COOLER if Jabra had made it compatible with nokia, Moto, and Ericsson phone chargers.  Now I have yet ANOTHER power supply to drag with me on trips....\\n\\nReception is very good as long as line of sight is unobstructed by anything full of water.  I can pump gas in my car with the phone on the passenger seat or wander all over my hotel suite waving my arms wildly while the phone sits in its charging stand on the desk.  If there is a body in the way (or an aquarium, etc) then the signal drops off (attenuates) dramatically.  In fact, there is a marked difference between putting the phone on the opposite side of your body from the earpiece when carrying your phone in your pocket.  If on the opposite side, the signal degrades noticeably.\\n\\nThe Cons:\\n\\nI have been unsuccessful getting it to pair with either my laptop or my PDA however (an HP iPaq 4155).\\n\\nIf you have a bluetooth PDA and use BT to Activesync with your PC, it will interfere with this headset while it is \"connected\" (from Activesync\\'s perspective).  You will hear a constant \"crackling\" noise that sounds like the other person is popping popcorn.  It took me a while to figure out.  You don\\'t have to turn off the BT radio on the laptop or PDA, just \"disconnect\" the BT session temporarily while talking.  This is a hassle, but not a killer (one of the reasons for 4 instead of 5 stars)\\n\\nMy biggest problem with the unit is that it does not fit my ears without feeling very insecure.  The \"hanging\" design always feels like it is flopping around for me, and if I lean too far to that side, the unit will actually fall off my ear.  There is no way to tighten the fit of the unit; I have already tried different earpieces and positions of the earpieces, but this doesn\\'t help.  This is the reason why I will probably replace this unit with another.  Its a shame, since it is such a nice unit, but the floppiness on my ears is unacceptable.\\n\\nBTW, I am not a midget - I am 5\\' 10 and weigh 160 lbs.  I have a fairly narrow face, but I think the bigger issue is that I have small earlobes.  If you have small earlobes (rather than pendulous ones) you may want to test fit this unit in a store before buying one here.  I wish I had...',\n",

Transmitted sound is also weak, apparently, I have to accept what others tell me. If I want to talk quietly I have to use the phone, the headset forces me to talk loudly so that I can be heard. Noise cancelling is non-existant, if it was supposed to have any. The draught from the AC vents on the car is enough to cause callers to complain.\\n\\nRF: With the v505 it takes an unreasonable amount of time for the headset and the phone to get it together. You can\\'t answer the phone by switching the headset on when you hear it ringing, by the time it\\'s connected to the phone the call is in voicemail. Received audio is OK, but whenever I used the headset I am told that I sound very digitized. As a communications engineer I believe that some people need a serious talking to over the bluetooth performance.\\n\\nAll in all I\\'d keep looking, which is why I\\'m browsing headsets now.\\n\\nIn ten years I really haven\\'t yet found a \"good\" headset, nothing approaching the standard of the military and aviation headsets I used to use, like comparing a ZX80 to a 3GHz Dell Pentium 4. Perhaps I just have unreasonable expectations, but if I could actually get a headset with good audio and good noise cancelling I\\'d pay a couple of hundred bucks. A decent noise cancelling headset will let you talk in a normal voice while standing between the exhausts of a 1500hp tank engine.',\n",

Easy wireing to the +12VDC hitch wire bundle and a bumper bolt ground, but, the fuse holder it came with prevented the fuse from making contact on one end.  After about an hour of troubleshooting I discovered the fuse was not contacting the the non-spring side of the fuse-holder and pushed it in. Time-will-tell if it will remain functional or if the contact will recede into the housing.  Then I would need to replace the fuse holder.  I think it is as nice a +12VDC outlet device as one can find, with the one star ding due to the questionable fuse holder it came with. Be aware of the seal loss from the heat shrinkage factor others mention; mine has not been on long enough to discover this problem.

At first I was somewhat disappointed with my phone because I could not get some of the internet functions to work. However, after some discussion with T-mobile customer service and a visit to the T-mobile office, I discovered that T-mobile had not properly prepared my phone...not Motorola's fault!\\n\\nMy V600's performance has been outstanding. Extremely long standby and talk times. The bluetooth connection works very well. I use mine with a Jabra BT250.\\n\\nThis is my third generation Motorola. After years of Nokia phones, I received a Motorola Timeport as a gift (terrible phone with lousy menus). The next year I won a v66 in a raffle. I was pleasantly surprised with the v66, especially it small size. Motorla had significantly improved the menu from the Timeport, but it still wasn't the best. The V600's menu has improved on the V66.\\n\\nThe V600's color screen is wonderfully clear and the pre-loaded ringtones are very nice. I don't really use the camera feature, but the few times that I fooled around with it found that it took decent pictures. Finally, I was concerned about the V600's size until I actually had it in my hand. While it is a little bit bigger than the V66, it is not much bulkier. I still wear it around my neck.\\n\\nOverall, I can highly recommend the V600 for its numerous features and nice styling.\",\n",

Reception is great, although I'm still not thrilled with T-Mobile's coverage here in the Northeast.\\n\\nWhat really excites me about the phone is the inclusion of Bluetooth and its quad-band capability. The latter means it'll get more coverage in the future as the new frequency is being implemented here in the U.S. (Does't make a difference overseas.) Bluetooth means I can finally use a wireless headset, and also hook up to my PDA and Fujitsu laptop.\\n\\nEven though this is available only for T-Mobile, it's one of the very best phones on the market today.\",\n",

I sweat in them on long runs, I wear them driving to talk (one ear only, obviously), and I wear them around the house listening to podcasts. They have never failed to pair, they have never sounded bad.\\n\\nMy only dislike is that they bounce around if you run with them. In winter (now) I tuck them under my jacket, but in summer they bounce and are annoying, but still usable. In summer I use 2 large safety pins to secure the ends to my shirt to keep them from moving around on my neck.\\n\\nAnd once I had to clear the memory (read how online at moto website).this was when I'd upgraded to a new phone and had too many devices paired, I think.\\n\\n1 month Update: I've been asked how they hold up with sweat (see below). No problem working up a sweat on the treadmill, but I must stress that I've not put in a summer run. I also must say that I do not expect longevity from a non-sweatoroof product, and that the s11 headphones are designed with a sweatproof nano coating. HOWEVER, since you asked, they still sound and work excellent. They bounce around running, but it's not intolerable... Just not ideal. BATTERY: I've used them every day since I got them, and often times days at the house studying all day and going to the gym. They last from morning to night constantly connected. I often forget I'm wearing them when I turn on my music and don't hear any sound from my phone/tablet.\\n\\nEdit: just for the record, the Motorola site says these are NOT for working out (under questions about product, it says not sweatproof and should be kept away from moisture). I'm going to work out in them anyway and I'll report back when they fail.\\n=============================================================\\n\\nI bought the jaybird bluebuds x for my girlfriend, and I've used them several times, so that is my comparison point.\\n\\nThese headphones have a very utilitarian, price conscious design. They don't sound as awesome as the $180 bluebuds, and they aren't as sleek as them (bluebuds are just a cord with tiny ear pieces). BUT, they are very easy to control, very light, and sound very good. I'm not taking away anything by saying they don't sound as good as the bluebuds... The bluebuds sound as good as Bose or klipsch wired models of similar cost (even MKBHD says they are amazing). The Motorola buds really sound great. I'd choose them based on sound over any of the cheaper wired sets I have (skull candy, JVC, etc.)\\n\\nThe ear pieces, at first, I was worried about them. They didn't look like they would be very secure, but I was wrong. You can easily work out with them and they will stay in. And they swivel a bit at the ear pieces, so every time you move, you don't hear a bunch of thumping like many in-ear wired sets.\\n\\nAnd taking them out to hear the world around you is nice, because of the magnets. No flopping around.\\n\\nThe built-in equalizer settings are nice, the controls are easy, and they stay around your neck when laying on your back.\\n\\nSo you sacrifice some portability over the bluebuds, but you get a great ease of use, very good sound, and less than half the price.\\n\\nAnd truthfully, while they aren't super stylish... People are walking around with those giant beats studio headphones on. These look way less ridiculous than that, and really aren't that bad. Don't wear them to a job interview.\",\n",

Its broken. All the other headsets I used in the past from LG worked until they were physically destroyed... broken wires, whatever.  Not this one.\\n\\nAnother maddening problem with the Buds is no fast forward or rewind. I didn't think to even look for this feature, I assumed no one would make a headset without it. Turns out they do. Another thing I'm ecstatic about never hearing again is WELCOME TO THE MOTOROLA BUDS!!!!!!!!! DEVICE ONE CONNECTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  literally blasting in my ears when i turn them on and forget that the buds are still in my ears. No way to adjust that and it appears they want to be sure deaf people know the headset is active. Loud beeps when you adjust the volume, too.\\n\\nIm actually glad they're dead because now I can replace them with a proper set and I was too cheap to do it while they still worked.

       "  'reviewText': 'I always care most about sound quality and signature of a Bluetooth earbuds or headphones.\\nfor me, that is the most important aspect of \"good BT headphone.\"\\n\\nAs far as sound quality and signature are concerned, this Motorola SF500 is one of the best in the class.  Specially, for the money I paid for ($19 with Lightening deal), it is an awesome BT headphone.  Very refined clear mid and high with decent, tight bass which is not very common at this price range.  Also when I check the built quality, it is solidly built and designed.  I should say that it can be compared to more expensive models of LG or Samsung BT headphones (but I like SF500 Sound quality much more).\\n\\nEven though I like the sound quality very much, I wish that the volume level could be bit louder.  When I compared to other similar price range BT headphones, such as SoundPEATS QY7 or Mpow, the volume isn\\'t quite loud enough.  It could go up one or two notch louder...\\nAlso unlike Samsung, LG and even Mpow, SF500 has very ridge body that you can not really bend as you like. For me, it fits me well enough since I have a normal size neck, but I can see that if someone with fatter or bigger neck, it might not fit comfortably due to its stiffness in the body of headphone.  Also, it has 3 EQ settings.  Personally I like the second one the most which brings out clear mid and high.  It is a good feature to have.\\n\\nThere are couple of black rubber rings to keep the wires and adjust the length of the earbud wires.  it is just a couple of flimsy rubber bands that could be broken in a week or two.  I hope that they had used something stronger plastic type rather than cheap & weak black rubber band.\\nalso, as you can see in the photos, the earbuds will be attached to the tips of the headphone by magnets.  The magnets are rather strong and they get attached well enough, but it seemed to me that how they made it was some sort of after thought.  Basically, it does not look good nor functionally well designed.  I rather prefer to see Samsung or LG type of more hidden and secure looking attachments.\\n\\nFinally, the earbuds are very small. Entire earbud structures and design are very small. Even the rubber earbuds that comes with 3 different sizes are smaller and flatter designed than other 99% of earbuds.  I think when I use the biggest earbuds, it works well enough and I get adequate seals when I listen to music.  But I just feel that they might slip off when I am running or doing some activities.\\n\\nMotorola SF500 is well made.  Good sounding and solid structure. However, there are many things to be improved. Small things.',\n",

I am comparing these against three versions of LG Tones that I have owned (the 750,810, and 900s) While I like the Tones but they have a bad habit of giving out within a year (the 900s lasted about 14 months) and are much more expensive. So I thought I'd give these a try.\\n\\nLove them. Great sound once I got the right earpieces on. Seems to be a quality build and being Motorola should last as long at least as the Tones. Controls were a little confusing at first (I hung up on one call trying to adjust the volume) but you will get used to it. Tone control is OK but not as responsive as the tones.\\nThe only gripe here is that the call/answer button is the same button that activates the music player and changes tone. Too many functions for one button. So when I go to place a call if I hold it down to short it instead begins to play music or too long it changes tone. I'm sure I'll get used to that too but for now because of this I deducted a star. You may feel different about the ergonomics because overall I am pleased.\",\n",

He does work a lot with moving boxes and stuff so maybe it's more suitable for using in the car or jogging. The other issue we found with this was that we tried connecting more than one phone to it but it would only recognize one of them. I'm not sure if there was something we were doing wrong but we tried the same process for the second phone as the first and we just couldn't seem to get it to connect to the second one. He hasn't been able to use it for a while because the earphone piece fell off again and got lost so now we need to replace that.

       "  'reviewText': \"This is my first review of a product. Anyway, here we go.\\n\\nSaw a flash sale for some Motorola SF500 Earbuds from Dailysteals.com. My last pair of earbuds stopped powering on. So, I jumped on these for the cheap price. Got these in two days with regular postal shipping.\\n\\nNo pics of the box they came in. I'm guessing these are either returned or refurbished. Everything was in labeled plastic bags.\\n\\nI received the earbuds, 3 set of ear tips, 1 charger with 2 ports,  USB cable, and a bag.\\n\\nWhen looking at the picture, on the left side, the bottom lowers and top button raises the volume. On the right side, the bottom button is play/pause. The top button forwards to the next song.\\n\\nThe headset paired easily to my HTC M8. The phone found the headset right way and paired.\\n\\nThe earpiece cables have rubber bands around them to keep them close to the headset. Its up to you if you want them on or not. Right now, I have them on.\\n\\nPlayed some Logic from Play Music and bass is decent. A little too much treble for me but I'll live with it. The headset sounds good when both ear pieces are in your ears.\\n\\nThe magnets that connect the earpieces to the headset is really good. They have not fallen once so far.\\n\\nI'm enjoying this headset so far. The accessibility and ease are outstanding. The headset feels light around my neck.\\n\\nI have no comparisons for these. These are my first pair of this type of headset. When this style first came out,  It wasn't on my radar to purchase some. I'm glad I did now. What took me so long?\\n\\nI'm no audiophile but I would refer someone to these.  They come in black or white.\\n\\nI have not made any phone calls yet.\\n\\nThanks for reading my first product review. Hope to do many more.\\n\\n#reviewlife  #mizfits  #motorola  #sf500\",\n",

They are very convenient for switching between music, phone, or nothing (i.e., life).  The sound is good.  The controls are convenient and take only a little getting used to, as is the case for all such headsets.  My pet peeve is at start-up, when a voice that is way too loud and distorted states that the \"device\" is on and...paired.  It is especially bizarre because these otherwise never distort either voice or music. Fix: I simply keep the buds out of my ear until that awful announcement is over, then plug in.\\n\\nUnfortunately, my buds just broke (volume in one ear dropped).  I looked around for alternatives but nothing looks that great (I have used similar Moto and LG earbud headsets).  And at this price, I am happy to buy again.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"Short review: Right earbud keeps dying. Appears to be broken wires from moving. However, Moto support is great and I willingly bought a third pair (second being the free replacement of initial pair) after my warranty ran out.\\n\\nLonger review:\\nI listen to loads of audiobooks. Easily eight hours a day, as I do chores and such. If my husband is out of town and I keep listening into the night, I can hit, like, fifteen hours of audio in a day. So I needed some headphones that weren't going to die on me within a month, like all the $10 pairs I'd kept compromising on.\\n\\nFor Hannukah 2014, my husband got me a pair of Motorola Buds, and I instantly fell in love. Never again were my earbuds yanked from my ears as the cord twisted, and the bluetooth was strong enough that I could have my phone charge centrally in my house and be able to walk about without losing reception. Not being an audio snob, I also found the sound quality for music to be fine. The battery life was just about right, though my headphones did die on me about once or twice a month, but, again, at least eight hours continuous use.\\n\\nHowever, as I said above, the right earbud keeps dying. It crackles a bit for a day or two, and then it's more like silence with a little crackling in every so often. My first pair of Buds started failing on June 10th, 2015, based on my e-mails (and I got the gift in mid-December). Luckily, Motorola has always been great about replacements for me (I also had a Moto X, which I broke...twice...). I was able to show my Amazon receipt and get a replacement in within a week, with Motorola paying shipping all ways.\\n\\nBut, today, January 4th, and JUST out of the one year warranty, my second pair of buds has died again. I checked Amazon, to see if any other products might compare, but everything I saw looked like small, shady companies with really, really bad grammar in their text. And the reviews...generally did not seem like real reviews, so much as paid reviews.\\n\\nSo I bought another pair, and I'm okay with that, because I LOVE THESE THINGS! $30 a year for exactly what I want in headphones is fine with me!\\n\\nNow, granted, when this next warranty runs out? I'm hoping there will be other items on the market to try which might not need replacing halfway through their minimum lifecycle. But, for now, with Motorola treating me so well, I'm willing to keep going.\",\n",

The S10 was a downgrade in sound quality from the older S9's (which had WOW EQ...the S10s had no EQ settings at all), so why would these be any better?  Man was I wrong.  I would imagine much of this is owed to the aptX codec that is supported by my Note 4 and the fact that they have brought back built-in EQ settings.  With my S10s I needed to use a phone EQ to make them sound even mediocre.  Not these.  I turned my EQ off and use the built-in and they sound amazing.\\n\\nAnother huge thing that has been upgraded is comfort.  Due to the odd shape and size of the earbuds on the S9s and S10s, if you wore them for more than an hour or so they became extremely uncomfortable.  These have moved to a more traditional earbud format, not to mention you don't look like the guy from Star Wars with some stupid blinking band wrapped around the back of your head, its a simple band looped around your neck with ample cord length for the buds.\\n\\nOverall, much improved over Moto's previous efforts, and a fantastic bargain, even at the full retail price, considering I paid over $50 for both my S9s and S10s.

       "  'reviewText': 'First of all, I just got these so I can\\'t speak to the longevity.  I\\'ve been using a $12 set of buds for almost a year and have put up with the hassle of the wires just because they sound so flippin good.  With a frequency response of 10 to 20,000Hz, I got all the bass I wanted as well as mid to high range.  That said, I was leery about BT ear buds but I\\'ve always been a fan of Moto products even though I have a Samsung Avant phone so I decided to give them a try.\\n\\nI got the buds yesterday, charged them up and tried them out.  I placed them on my neck and they curved down and rested on my collar bone very comfortably.  I turned them on with the button which is located in the back; kind of awkward but not a deal breaker.  Pairing them with my Samsung  Avant phone was very quick and easy; the Avant recognized them immediately and all I had to do was confirm the pairing. The first thing I noticed was that the sound wasn\\'t as rich or deep as I had hoped.  The buds felt like they wanted to pull out because the connecting wires seemed to stretch to their limits as I turned my head and I don\\'t have a big neck and, even though I have been accused of having a big head, it is actually quite average.  I had read about this being an issue from another reviewer so I moved the adjustment bands all the way back to give me as much wire as possible and that helped but anything rubbing against them, like a shirt collar, might be a hindrance, plus, I was still bothered about the sound.\\n\\nI started playing with the buttons after reading the directions in the instruction manual and found they were reversed from my buds.  It showed the volume on the on the left side but when I pushed the left front button, I got the EQ.  Rotating through the EQ\\'s didn\\'t seem to make much difference.  The volume adjustment was actually on the right side and the call/play and track buttons are on the left side.  Once I got that figured out, I was ok.  Also, if you have a smart watch, you might not even have to worry about the controls.  I have a Moto360 and it also pairs to the phone at the same time as the buds so that just a plus for me.\\n\\nBack to the buds.  Because the buds come with the smallest ear pieces installed, I thought it might help to use the medium buds so I switched them for the small ones and they helped with the problem of them staying in my ears but didn\\'t really improve the sound.  (By the way, they fit on the headset pretty snuggly so I don\\'t think they will likely fall off and get lost.) While wearing them today, I found that the sound was okay with voices like comedy routines and wasn\\'t too bad for normal music but I wanted more base.  I discovered that if I cupped my hands over my ears that I could hear the deeper base of the techno music I was listening to ... but I looked like an idiot so that wasn\\'t a solution.  I was actually ready to send them back for a refund but when I got home I decided to try one more thing.  If I was covering the buds with my hands and they sounded better, maybe sound was \"leaking out\" so I tried the larger ear pieces.  In all honesty, that sounds like a stupid explanation but the bigger ear pieces do give me more base ... not nose bleed bass but adequate.  So, I listened to Southern rock to Techno to Classical and they all sound great to these aging ears so now I\\'ll just have to see how the battery life is.\\n\\nAs for the Bluetooth, now that I have them paired, they hook up almost instantly.  I can\\'t use them in the car because I have a BT transmitter for the stereo and they conflict with each other but other than that, I can roam around without dropping the BT on the earbuds.  By the way, I also noticed a difference in the EQ by switching ear pieces, albeit ever so slight.  One setting sounds like it has less bass, one with a little more and one with almost a slight bassy echo.\\n\\nSo, for me, the only cons (kind of) right now are:\\n  - Power button is in the back behind your neck so are not real convenient.\\n  - Status light is in the back behind your neck (not a problem if you have eyes in the back of your head).\\n  - Connecting wires for the buds could be a tad longer.\\n  - Sound could be fuller but probably decent for this price point.\\nbut none of these are a real reason to deduct a star',\n",

I've paired with Android and iOS devices without any issues.\\nTwo things to be aware of: 1) this is not a waterproof/sweatproof device. I have sweat a lot on mine without a problem, but I've heard other people complain about that.

You forget they\\'re even there.\\n- Microphone is excellent, clear, loud, and crisp.\\n- Price! These are half the price of your Sony SBH or your LG Tones, and the battery life is better as a trade off for sound quality and style.\\n\\nCons:\\n- Earbud cables are a bit constraining if you have a long neck. They sometimes pop out of the ear when you turn your head suddenly.\\n- Music quality is not the greatest, but will do in a pinch.\\n- First pair I ordered had a defective left ear bud. Amazon to the rescue there. Quick and painless RMA and the next set were perfect.\\n\\nTo Buy or Not to Buy:\\n- If you want style and rich quality sound for music and media playback, look elsewhere.\\n- If you need a go to \"git \\'er done\" headset for calls and basic audio, and you don\\'t want to break the bank, these are for you!\\n\\nThe Moto Buds are extremely lightweight and easy to pair with nearly every device that supports BlueTooth 4.0. They are comfortable in the ear for extended wear (2-4 hours), the battery life is astoundingly good, and they sleep without draining battery better than the LG Tones or the Sony SBH series.\\n\\nBut every rose has its thorns, and alas the Moto Buds are not without their flaws. The first is these danged ear bud cables. Someone in accounting figured out the average neck length and forced the designers to shorten these things to exactly that length and no longer. As a person of above average height, this poses a problem for me, as the cables stay nearly taut all the time, even when I\\'m looking straight ahead. Turn your head to the left or right and at best you\\'re going to loosen one bud, or completely pull it out of your ear at worst.\\n\\nI\\'ve learned to forgive the Moto Buds for this over time because whenever I need them, they work perfectly. I regularly pair them with a laptop, tablet, and phone, and switching between those devices is remarkably simple and straight forward. Oh, and they\\'re less than half the price of the competition. Let\\'s not forget that!\\n\\nSound quality is adequate, but basses are not as deep, and highs are not as clear as other, more music-focused headsets. These are your go-to utilitarian communication earbuds, that will also let you listen to Taylor Swift on your coffee break. She just won\\'t sound as good.\\n\\nThe controls for music and volume are a tad awkwardly placed, and learning how to use the textured skip button as the pause/play button also is a little tricky, but once you\\'ve learned it, you\\'ve mastered it.\\n\\nMoto would do well to increase the earbud cable length, even if only by 5 centimeters, to allow the wearer more freedom of movement. However, if you\\'ll be wearing these while sitting at your desk or driving in your car most of the time, you\\'ll have no trouble at all, especially if you are of average height or less.',\n",
