       " 'i got this version instead of the ps3 version which turned out to be a mistake console versions of games look 95 percent as good as their pc versions but you do not have to deal with driver issues and the numerous things that can go wrong with windows first off the installation takes about 30 minutes which is ridiculous i have never had a game take this long to load shift 2 took about 20 minutes which seemed too long also next many of the latest games for pc are forcing you to have an internet connection in order to install the game regardless of whether you want to play only offline single player games shift 2 unleashed is also like this so be forewarned internet requirements are not prominently displayed on the boxes the game pushes you but does not require you to sign up for a games for windows live account which is required to get the game patches and updates more time wasted signing up for that finally after about one hour the game was up and running  but the menu screen text had red blocky borders and the sun in the game screens was ugly pink red with red reflections on the car and everywhere so more time spent googling to find a solution to this i had to download a hot-fix driver update for my amd videocard driver which solved that red text and sun problem finally after nearly 2 hours i was able to play the game which is perhaps the prettiest racing game i have ever played magnificent graphics and fun excellent gameplay good forcefeedback effects with a steering wheel and excellent sense of speed and immersion makes this a top notch sim racer with just a hint of arcade feeling to iti was really finally enjoying the game  when suddenly about 30 minutes in to a race the game suddenly crashed no error message or anything it just hung up and crashed to desktop under windows 7 i later tried it with windows xp on the same machine and it crashed less frequently usually only when exiting the game but random crashes really kill the fun of a racing game since it might not crash during an entire 20 lap race or it might crash on the 2nd lapit is a great game when it works and if you are lucky enough to have a machine that it runs stably on then by all means get this game but hang on to your receipt just in casei am tired of fiddling with my computer trying to find a totally reliable setup for this game so i think i am going to buy a copy for my ps3 which has never crashed in over 3 years of game playing i have been buying the top notch pc versions of videogames and spent thousands of dollars over the years on faster videocards and cpu\\'s  but i have finally grown tired of fiddling with incompatibilities of hardware and software and now game publishers demanding that you have an internet connection as well as providing a long serial number utilizing gigabytes of harddrive space 30 minute or longer installation times ( it takes less time to install windows 7 )  and requiring you to sign up for their online service and game store and still you have to put that stupid little dvd in your computer everytime you want to play a simple game to relax i am pretty much done with pc gaming since the consoles are so much less hassle and they have \" good enough \" graphics that the diminishing returns of costly higher resolution better antialiased higher framerate graphics is not worth it when the ps4 and xbox 720 come out i think the law of diminishing returns will be even more evident',\n",

will hate this due to all the flaws that stick out to many \"mazy\" levelsman o\\' man does this bring back a lot of good memories i remember almost dying because my mom\\'s computer couldn\\'t run hl1 i begged her to get the computer upgraded (at the time not even knowing how this was possible or the cost) she just wouldn\\'t do it all i could do was stare at videos and screenshots until i thought would be forever *da-da-da* until i heard about the ps2 port i was so excited i babysat my bratty sisters for a whole summer and laid down $200 smackeroonies on a used ps2 but to my luck hl was no where to be seen it turns out not many copies of the game were made so they were scarce settling with a rental i finally was able to play the game but it was starting to feel old because i didn\\'t get ahold of it until late 2003 realizing that i was missing out on a lot at the time i wound up losing my save and being so angry never touched the game again four years later i can finally play the game again thanks to steam (i actually ordered the hl1 anthology off of ebgames for $20) and i definitely realized what i missed now that i have finally been able to finish the gamehalf-life used the quake ii engine at the time which was fighting against the unreal engine technically while half-life never looked as good as unreal valve pulled some strings and did some custom stuff with the physics water and lighting effects that wasn\\'t originally in the q2 engine hl isn\\'t just your regular run & gun shooter the story is told all in real time by running into certain characters and by just progressing you get an idea of what\\'s going on without much dialog this was revolutionary at the time and so were the weapons graphics sound physics and enemies the game has your usual weapons like machine guns with grenade launchers pistols revolvers etc but hl has some weapons up it\\'s sleeve that were never seen before those such weapons happen to be a laser guided rocket launcher (you guide it with your mouse) i remember people buzzing about this weapons back in the day and it\\'s still pretty cool you also have the bee gun which is a weird slimy thing that shoots killer bees you have some strange electricity guns mines laser mines satchel charges etcthe enemies were also something never seen before like the head crabs head crab zombies the ichthyosaur the vortigaunts etc the game also had huge bosses which was amazing back in the day and seemed very epic the game was dark creepy and very hard as well most shooters back in the late 90\\'s were just run & gun nonsense in dark tunnels military complexes etc half-life is not innocent and does do this but there are other places to see like climbing a huge canyon and looking out over the *ugly* vista that looks like the grand canyon today it looks like someone slapped a low-res jpeg image in the background but in the late 90\\'s things like this seemed like you were staring over a grindlift in gears of war 2 half-life was just so real and so amazing back in it\\'s day that it really kind of shocks you how such an old game can still make that kind of impactthe game also consists of a lot of maze like halls that you can get easily lost in and i found this the main problem with hl some of the puzzles were a bit confusing to do and navigating the endless halls calls for a much needed walkthrough while the level design is excellent and you pretty much know where to go there are those occasional moments that make you wander around the whole area a few times and look in every nook and cranny wondering what switch you missed or what do you need to go through some neat things back in the day was being able to have the blue shift men help you and ask scientists to open doors for you while this is standard these days this kind of ai was unknown to the late 90\\'s pc gamers this added to the realism and made you fee like you really are stuck in black mesa trying to fight off the alien invasionyou\\'re probably wondering what the story is right well it\\'s simple really gordan freeman (that\\'s you) arrives in anomalous hazards as a regular employee and an experiment goes awry and gordan must escape the facility and figure out the source of the alien invasion the story as i\\'ve already said isn\\'t told through cut scenes but rather in real time while you play this helps add to the experience but of course may bore most younger pc gamers who are used to fear crysis cod etc half-life is for the hardcore old school pc shooter fans only and really takes cunning skill to finish the game will give you less and less health as you go and you\\'ll have to figure out how to take out a room of 10 bad guys with only 2 health while this isn\\'t impossible it can be done and requires precise skill (thus only for hardcore fans)most of you have probably played hl2 already and these games are pretty much completely different besides the content you still have your hazard suit most of the weapons are the same but there is more stuff in hl1 about 40% of the weapons and enemies in hl1 aren\\'t in hl2 hl2 is more realistic while hl1 is more of a sci-fi type game thankfully you can play hl2 without even touching hl1 (which i did) but hl1 explains a lot of things that aren\\'t explained in hl2 and there are bits in hl2 that are for fans of hl1 that you normally wouldn\\'t know about unless you played this gamenow of course hl1 has a lot of flaws like floaty physics being able to run 100mph cheap deaths poor graphics but these are flaws seen from age if you were to warp back to 1998 the game was almost flawless now when it comes to upgrades and mods there is an endless ocean there are a ton of amazing multiplayer and singe player mods available and i have spend hours and hours on most of them you must go to fileplanetcom and download these mods because they are super fun hl1 also has a free hi-def pack that you can download to update the graphics a little bit if you want to go even further pick up half-life: source which uses hl2\\'s engine to make things look more modern i highly recommend the source version for people who just can\\'t stand \"old graphics\" but old school shooter fan should just get the hi-def pack just for nostalgia\\'s sake',\n",

been playing for a while because it doesn\\'t auto save between load screens  otherwise it played very smoothly on the newer system  you can also get the unreal anthology which has been updated to handle windows xp  oh and this was on a pentium 4 30 ghz systemthat being said i\\'ll move onto the actual review for anyone thinking about delving into this great game for their first time  the first thing you notice is that you have almost no health  you begin to discover why as you start wandering around a crashed space ship and it appears you were some kind of prisoner  naturally the first things you need to do are finding some health and then find some way out of the ship  the ship is kind of a boring part of the level but it leads you a bit into the story line because you clearly crash landed on an alien planet  when you finally get out of the ship the first thing you\\'ll notice is how amazing and stunning the world is that has been created for you  outside it\\'s very bright and vibrant in spots  this felt a little different compared to games like quake half life doom because a lot of those games are very dark and have a major dungeon crawl atmosphere to them  unreal has a lot of that usual stuff as well but it also has a lot of time spent outside where you get to see amazing scenery  one thing the developers did right was making you feel like the in game world was huge  this was really impressive and fun when you first got into itas you explore and interact with the world you learn more about what\\'s going on with this planet called na pali  apparently the native people are called the nali and they\\'ve been enslaved by an alien race called the skaarj  the nali are extreme pacifists and i can\\'t help but think their designers wanted them to be buddhists for the most part  the skaarj on the other hand are the main enemy of the game though not the only enemy creatures you\\'ll face  they are a warrior race that pretty much takes over wherever it sees fit  you\\'ll notice that the skaarj design is clearly influenced by predator  they have a humanoid lizard design and have a mouth design that looks just like that of a predator  to brandish even more similarities they also have energy weapons and steel double claws attached to their arms  as you can see this isn\\'t very original  another part that is kind of unoriginal/strange is the nali castles that you come across  they are clearly living in what we would term a medieval level society versus the skaarj who have high grade technology  strangely you come across large castles that look like they\\'re straight out of thirteenth century england  i know strange for a race of pacifists  despite all this those parts are some of the most fun to play through  i loved going into the castles and running aroundanother aspect that made unreal very special when compared to other fps games was the sheer amount of atmosphere that is injected into this game  it truly does feel like you\\'re on an alien world  the sounds the textures were all there perfectly bringing you into this world almost so much that you didn\\'t want to leave  you even hear echoes off of cliffs if you\\'re walking through a cavern it\\'s like they tried to get as many little details in order to immerse the user  for it\\'s time the unreal graphics engine was also very impressive and really took things up a notch in the gaming world  they also programmed enemies to react more realistically to the user when confronted  so when i\\'m fighting against the skaarj enemies they will actually make an effort to jump out of the way of my shots  this was really cool to see and i really only found that in games like half lifethe maps you have to navigate through are pretty massive at times  i really felt like a lot of the level design was also influenced by the great game marathon  a lot of times in order to open a door you have to search out a series of levers or whatever in order to proceed onto the next section  this game literally has hours of game play and probably took me in the vicinity of 20 to 30 hours to complete so you really get your moneys worth  the downfall to having such large maps is it\\'s kind of easy to get lost sometimes if you\\'re trying to complete certain tasks  another detriment to the game was the lighting  i put this game on maximum brightness levels in order to help me see where i was going  sometimes that wasn\\'t even bright enough  there are sections of this game that are absolutely dark especially towards the end of the game  while this creates a very scary atmosphere i felt it hindered the game play once in a while  the reason this hurts game play is because the flashlight function is incredibly annoying to deal with  you have to pick up flashlights or flares in order to see in the pitch black areas  now to make it more realistic the flashlights eventually run out of batteries or something but this was poorly incorporated because they only last a few minutes  seriously the flashlights in real life would not die so quickly and then it\\'s up to you to go find another one  the only reason this hurts the game is because if you no longer have light you can\\'t enjoy the environment nearly as muchaside from a couple flaws this is a pretty awesome game and i had a lot of fun playing it  in \\'98 this came out around the same time as half life and they were both the must play fps games that year  half life ultimately won the game of the year slot mainly because of story line  unfortunately unreal\\'s story line is pretty poor in the greater scheme of things  the user doesn\\'t really feel a greater purpose to their mission and instead you are merely trying to complete levels and puzzles  whereas half life created a vastly well written world where you were trying to get out of a facility and stop an experiment gone out of control  unreal just couldn\\'t compete with something of that caliber and it\\'s not nearly as engrossing on that level  beautiful world and really fun to play overall but not the best of the yearoverall rating: 45 out of 5',\n",

doom ii when descent ii appeared in 1996 i thought for  sure that the game would take off but it didn't happen however it wasn't  about to stop me from enjoying a terrific game now we have arrived to this  place and once again interplay has unleashed a new descent and one that  takes full advantage of 3d cards and more powerful computersdescent iii also features a new game engine known as fusion that enables  the player to move from the familiar mines of the post terran mining  corporation out to the planet's surface and surrounding environments i  guess this is hard to do in this sort of game additionally they have  improved the ai and it really shows in the way the robots behave and  there is a significant increase danger to your ship in combat the robots  are all new and feature more polygons and detailed texture mapping than  every before additionally 3d acceleration is probably the best i have  ever seen in any game descent 3 uses more dynamic light effects than any  game i have ever seen in fact it is so graphically intensive it is one  of the reasons why i upgraded my 200 mhz to an athlon 700 the demo ran  fine on my old system but when i bought the full version even when i  turned off all of the special effects it barely ran i would recommend at  least pii 300 as does interplayd3 provides much of the same kind  of game play as its other incarnations it's just better i have friends  who cannot play the game because they get disoriented too easily when  working in the three dimensions of the mines however if you're like me  you get a certain thrill from the constant direction changes as you blast  away at nasty robots with impunity d3 offers a new spread of weapons  including frag missiles that burst apart in a shower of mini-projectiles;  impact mortar which create very large localized explosions and heaps of  damage; the vauss cannon which is an updated variant of my favorite gauss  cannon gone are the earth shaker missiles replaced now with the black  shark a singularity weapon which turns hunting `bots into a skeet shoot  basically there are enough weapons to make your average nra lobbyist drool  with envyof course none of this means a tinker's cuss if it's no  fun to play right well get ready `cause you're going downagainthe pace of the game is much faster than the original thanks mostly due to  the quicker response and aggressiveness of the robots it is here you will  see the improved ai in action because the robots will come after you will  work in teams they do not cluster together to make mass-kills easier and  at higher skill settings they most certainly will take you apart the rush  is incredible when you're fighting like mad in the early levels just to  stay alive the napalm-equipped bots are ferocious and stick to you like  their weapons do the robot generator areas-the one's that replicate new  attack bots keeps churning them out as fast as you can shoot them down  the game can be relentless at times which is what a player wantsnow as for the story you play the material defender ptmc's itinerant  mercenary from the previous two games and who went mia at the end of d2  thanks to a defective jump drive after you are rescued by a rebel faction  on mars who wants to expose ptmc and their evil ceo dravis as being  responsible for the alien virus spreading to ptmc's robots and facilities  it becomes all-out battle against ptmc who like all rich corporations  have their own squadrons of pyro gx fighters and start coming after you  see and you thought big companies just didn't care about the little people  anymorethe only place where d3 suffers is the in-game music it's  boring lifeless and worse it sounds like the music we listened to in  computer games a decade ago that is also not to say d2's skinny puppy or  type o negative was any better i guess because it was an industrial  setting (a mine) they assumed that we'd want to hear industrial music  wrong (and i like industrial) i found myself turning the music off and  reaching for a star wars soundtrack to plop in my cd player to accompany  the game beyond that i have little to complain about this is a top notch  game as far as game play visuals and sound effects are concerned it's got  a break neck pace at times while at others it's slow-paced which can get  really creepy until the first robot jumps you and you wet your undies in  shockthe descent series have always been my favorite first person  shooter (along with jedi knight) and d3 does not disappoint in any way  the visuals and fmv cut scenes are stunning and the sound is excellent i  highly recommend for anyone so equipped with environment audio on their  sound card to use the full four speaker set up because d3 was produced and  recorded in dolby surround and it just adds so much to the experience  you'll also need a death machine of a system to run it\",\n",

       " 'i really liked this game  i played pen & pencil dungeons & dragons for years so i have an appreciation of the dungeon-master concept behind this game  dungeon keeper 2 is a blend of real-time strategy base-building and sim-developing but the real treat is being able to play as naughty as you want--and be rewarded for it  there are a few things that i would change about dk2 but overall i found it quite enjoyable even years after its initial releasegameplay: there are three different gameplay modes  first there is the campaign which includes several mission in which you snuff out the lairs of heroes and rival keepers on your way to dominating the region  typically you build a base by tunneling out rooms and finding gold attract a legion of monster henchmen while doing so and then take on the forces of your rival  there is enough variation in the missions to prevent boredom although there are a few very tough missions (especially the last two)  there is also a skirmish mode that lets you fight against 1-3 rival keepers while fighting off other interlopers the skirmish game can be customized in various ways although there are only about 20 maps  finally there is a \"my pet dungeon\" mode for those who just want to build their subterranean masterpieces without being troubled by opposition (although you can choose to include set-piece battles against heroes) all of the gameplay modes have their appeal though i liked the campaign and skirmish the best  the game can be played online but i suspect there is not much of a multiplayer community these daysthe game is fairly easy to play once you master the controls  you\\'ll need certain rooms in place (lair hatchery blacksmith prison torture chamber and library) to really get things going along with a number of choice spells (heal rally make gold) that can be researched at the library  you have limited control of your creatures beyond being able to drag and drop them  you can take direct control over a creature with the possession spell and even have a number of creatures follow you  this puts the game into first-person perspective which can be fun but not all that useful in later stages of the campaign but again the real joy of the game is all of the naughty things that you can do like torture captured heroes in your custom-built torture chamber have corpses drug to your graveyard where they might eventually attract a vampire to do your bidding or summon the god-like horny devil to turn the tide of a battle  a fully fleshed-out dungeon feels almost like a small town under your control and you can spend hours just admiring and tinkering with your handy work (or trying to keep your minions happy)  and though a somewhat dark game dk2 has more than its share of humor from the vincent price-like narrator to the casino that gives you a ridiculously funny treat if one of your monsters hits the jackpot  the game never comes across as cheesy or trivial but it obviously does not take itself too seriousgraphics: for a game that came out in the late 1990s dk2 looks pretty good  models are detailed enough to be credible representations of various monsters and animations are pretty decent  some models such as the enemy hero lords are used too often but otherwise the visuals are good enough to allow the game to immerse yousounds: the game does have enough sound effects to convince you that it takes place in an underground dungeon  however the best sounds are the voice acting which is top-knotch all the way around  the narrator is both sinister and hilarious and the enemy heroes are over-the-top in their arrogant dismissive attitudes toward evil  the music is okay but not particularly grippingtechnical issues: the game has been quite stable on my system even though i have xp with service pack 2 be sure to install the latest game patch before playingreplayability/value: i picked this game up new for about $12 on ebay so i certainly got my money\\'s worth i don\\'t see much replay value in the campaign though i can imagine replaying it again at least once  the skirmish mode is decent and there are enough maps to keep you playing for a while  if you are looking to play online i\\'m afraid you\\'ll have a hard time finding a gamepros:+great concept for a game+terrific voice acting+a few different gameplay modes+the dark humor is spot on+\"it\\'s good to be bad\"cons:+no online community at this point+a few frustrating campaign missions+no modding community to speak of',\n",

       " \"another addicting game i have been trying to play this game and the sims at the same time and there just isn't enough time i played this for 6 hours yesterday (sunday) and wondered where the time had gone i had bought disney's coaster several years ago and thought this game would be just like it wrong this game is way better you have several scenarios you play plus you can play and redo real amusement parks they give you lots a money to start with to build up your park you control the admission fees the price for all of the rides price on the food and you can even charge people for usin the restrooms you hire mechanics people to mow and clean garbage security guards and entertainers you can change the color of every ride and play your choice of music there a banners that will display any message you type plus you can name any ride or food place the best thing is you can design your own rollercoasters and water rides though they are expensive (don't build your water ride too big as you typically only have 2 boats and the lines get long and customers get upset) you also do your own landscaping and you can see what every customer in your park is thinking and how each ride is liked if you choose to you can watch them ride each of your rides the only conflict with the game i have seen was what they call &quot;thrill rides&quot; when you go to build these the excitement level is typically low to moderate so i am not sure why they call those thrill ridesthis is a very addicting game and time will get away i think if you get this game  you will also get addicted and then you will have to go buy the other 2 expansion packs just like i did\",\n",
       " \"i happened to play sim theme park (stp) first which i liked but in which the gameplay was constantly interrupted by a need to fix the rides  and while playing it i was thinking &quot;well if that wasn't part of the game what would there be left to do&quot; now i get ityou can set up a park in roller coaster tycoon (rct) that basically runs itself  if you staff it well you won't even have to worry (much) about the usual things that turn guests off (litter vandalism lack of facilities etc) and what are you doing during all this planning expansions landscaping building roller-coasters and it's surprisingly entertaininga comparison with stp is useful here: in stp i would repeatedly find some little detail and think &quot;well that was cool&quot; the artistry of that game is elaborate--but inside of a week or two of fairly casual play i had seen all there was to see in rct though the sensation one has is of actually making a park his own as opposed to just arranging elements that an artist has given him (you're still arranging someone else's artwork in rct but the pieces are small enough tht it doesn't feel that way)stp has the ultra-cool first-person perspective option courtesy bullfrog's ultra-cool dungeon keeper/populous/theme park engine--and yet the graphics in that game are so gaudy as to be somewhat tiring rct's decidedly more primitive graphics are actually easier to look at after a while and really encourage you to landscape your park the two main drawbacks of the engine are that there's no first person view and that you can only rotate the isometric view by 90 degreesstp's free rotation and zoom would be welcome here but rct provides myriad different views by allowing you to hide different features of the park and terrain in fact the depth of various rct tools are amazing some of which i was surprised were left out of stp (which was released after)  in fact i find myself hesitant to state that there are tools missing from rct because i've found so many of them after thinking &quot;i wish the game gave me a way to&quot;the game is not perfect of course what is the deal with handymen in stp you could drop your handyman on top of six piles of vomit and he might just walk away in rct he'll clean them up but you'll wonder why he hadn't done it before (the manuals even admonish you that your handymen are sort of clueless i think it must be some sort of ai problem)the route-setting mechanism in rct is more primitive than stp's (where you just have to drag your mouse around the area you want your worker to partol) but surprisingly rct's works better in the sense that it's much easier to add or remove a section of the park from someone's route neither game has a feature for you to say &quot;who's patrolling this area&quot; which results in some drudge work when your park gets big you can't rename your workers in rct either which was a big help in stp for keeping track of themalso rct allows you to do some very cool stuff with tunnels and bridges but it's hard to patrol those areas in an early game i ended up putting a roller-coaster very very high up because of the way the terrain was and i could =not= get mechanics to inspect the ride resulting in the deaths of 16 poor little sims when the coaster suddenly flew off the track (so much for that &quot;safest park&quot; award)probably the most disturbing aspect of the ai in this game is how easily the guests get lost one of the maps has a beautiful flower garden arranged in columns with one aisle going down the center and guests entering that will never find their way out you can build a perfectly feasible real-world map and end up with an rct-world mess often a creative solution is available thoughbut again most of these complaints feel like nitpicks i can see why this game has persisted on the top ten charts for two years and i'm glad i got it as a sort of &quot;antidote&quot; to &quot;black and white&quot; it doesn't ask you any deep philosophical questions and it doesn't really challenge one's ideas about what computer games can be or do: it's just funbefore i end this let me add that this game is somewhat tougher to learn than sim theme park i could see 6-8 year olds playing stp whereas this game strikes me as having a 10-year old lower level\",\n",
       " \"this game is wonderful  i couldn't believe the amount of physics in this game  you have a lot of rides to choose from and endless opportunities  one really good thing about this game is that there's a lot of levels which is really suprising for a sim game  the game has a nice learning curve although it's pretty difficult to make a good roller coaster when you're inexperienced  the graphics are really good considering it doesn't take much to run the game  it's really fun watching roller coaster cars going fifty miles per hour through loops corkscrews helixes and many more special track designs  sound is great also  you hear people laughing screaming when you overlook your park masterpiece  the conversation sounds even get louder when you get to more crowded areas  this is a great game; i suggest every sim lover should buy it\",\n",

       " 'i had to write a follow-up review now that about 3 years has passed since my last one and two sequels to this game have been published  despite playing the newer games i dusted off and fired up my old copy of jedi knight/mystery of the sith (jk/mots) and had a blast  the two are obviously dated but don\\'t suffer as much in comparison in terms of game play as the original \"dark forces\" (circa 1994) had in light of jk/mots  like df all the games in the jedi knight series are first person shooters  jk/mots added the lightsaber and force powers with an enhanced game engine - besides better graphics and sound it was now possible to combine moth horizontal and vertical head movements using the mouse (df had separate buttons for vertical looking which made the interface feel exceedingly clunky in comparison)  also basic movements were more natural - you never had that feeling prevalent in df that you were a golf cart instead of a personbut above the improved engine jk excelled because it was as much a sw experience as it was a game - with a tight story line excellent level design and filmed fmv cut scenes  (most people hated the cut-scenes - poorly acted and not very effects laden - but i loved them; they added to the movie-like feeling and anyway \"attack of the clones\" had horrible acting and scenes that went on much longer) you never had that feeling of other shooter games where you suddenly stopped and wondered - ok where am i what am i looking for and why am i hitting all of these buttons  the story returns pro-rebel mercenary kyle katarn to the fore  learning that his father was killed by an evil dark jedi named jerec kyle sets off on a mission of revenge soon he learns more - that jerec rules an entire faction of imperials intent on locating the lost \"valley of the jedi\" (also featured in \"jedi outcast\")  the burial place of countless jedi the valley also holds a bottomless reservoir of their force power  the plot has kyle tracking a traitorous droid named 8t88 from nar shadaa to his father\\'s home planet of sulon (the droid decodes a map leading to the valley - the map is then destroyed)  great level design makes each player map seem less a map than a place that must be navigated  ai suffers in terms of the imperial troops - who prove bad enough before their blasters are force-grabbed away  balancing that out the game is generous with boss modes - sending you up for 5 lightsaber duels with the dark jedi including the climactic duel with jerec  personally i hated the saber duels - they always seemed to boil down to hopping and slashing with sabers  (jedi outcast is most improved in that respect - there are much better looking duels and more of them)  your force powers are divided between generic powers (speed jump sight) and those specific to light (heal persuasion) or dark (lightning) forces  your reliance on dark or light powers (and your ability to keep from killing various innocent by-standers) will determine whether you are a light or dark jedi  (the consequent difference for one side or another is not that great - mostly it determines which of jerec\\'s evil jedi you will fight in one of the latter duels and which cut scenes you\\'ll watch)  sound and graphics compare well with the newer games and the overall plot makes you feel like you\\'re in a star wars moviethis edition also comes with \"mysteries of the sith\" - a companion disk that uses a slightly altered game engine and was originally released separately but otherwise required jk be installed  in mots you play katarn for the first several missions then assume the role of mara jade a former imperial agent brought to the light (her character was introduced in the novels of timothy zahn)  the tight plotting of the first game is gone - replaced by looser story arcs (as kyle you must save a rebel base from an imperial ground assault then destroy an orbiting asteroid the imperials are using to stage their attack; as mara you will infiltrate the palace of kapa the hutt and then in a switch go to work for him; you will also track down and try to retrieve a jedi holocron and save a rebel corvette from marauding pirates; eventually you will follow kyle back to a mysterious planet of the sith where it\\'s dark and swampy the locals are hostile and hungry and your weapons don\\'t work)  if uneven mots has its share of thrills and challenges  ai is noticeably improved (with stormtroopers ready to go fisticuffs when their blasters are force-grabbed) and gameplay is much more challenging on the whole  should you tire of the levels provided an entire on-line community has crafted single and multi-player levels for both gamesin short both games are still great values and enjoyment isn\\'t terribly undermined by your having played jedi outcast - though it\\'s obviously not the mind-blowing experience of 1997 (still it\\'s aged better than the spice girls)  if you\\'ve got a p4 - it\\'s just an excuse to turn the graphics up to excessive  i first played this on my p200mmx computer with voodooii graphics acceleration and enjoyed every minute  on my p4 i had no windows xp problems and was able to crank graphics to the full',\n",

       " \"this was the first computer game i ever bought  i'd been hearing about it since '96 when pc gamer did a feature on it and after reading that article i knew i'd be buying this game  in fact i went and bought it before i even had a computer of my own to play it on  when it came out in the fall of '97 it blew the doors off every magazine that reviewed it  until half-life came out a year later this game was the one to beat  and granted the graphics are pretty seriously dated now in 2005 it's still a great game; a true classicnow let me tell you whythis was the first game that brought a true melee weapon -- a lightsaber -- and force powers into an fps and made them work flawlessly something no one thought was possible until then  it was also the last game (until enter the matrix) that used fmv sequences between missions that actually helped flesh out the story taking placekyle katarn is the name of the man you play as  he's a former imperial officer who resigned out of rage when he learned his father had been killed by imperial operatives  he joined up with the rebel alliance and you played as him in the game dark forces which was sort of a prequel to this gamenow it's a year after return of the jedi  the empire is reeling fractured disorganized and the alliance's star is rising  but the game doesn't begin with that; instead it starts with the execution of a jedi knight who's been in hiding all this time  this jedi qu rahn has been living on the run because he has a secret that would've meant absolute power in the hands of anyone who gets it  who kills him  jerec a dark jedi aided by six others like him who will do anything to get that secretthat secret is the valley of the jedi an ancient jedi burial ground where the force is extremely concentrated  anyone who taps into that massive stockpile of power would gain literal godlike abilities in the forceso what does all this have to do with kyle katarn  simple; his father morgan knew the hidden location of the valley  morgan was good friends with rahn  and morgan was murdered by jerec who didn't know what secrets morgan had  it quickly becomes a journey of self-discovery for kyle who takes up rahn's lost lightsaber and races to beat jerec and his allies from finding the valley and stop them from exploiting its poweror taking that power for himselfthis game had two different endings depending on which path you choose  if you choose dark force abilities and you callously slaughter civilians you become a dark jedi yourself competing with jerec over the valley's fate  but if you choose light force abilities and you go out of your way to defend civilians you'll become a jedi knight and work to protect the valley from jerec and his dark jedijedi knight blew me away when i played it  i loved every aspect of it all of which was thanks to justin chin who was the project leader and who wrote the story  he did an incredible job make no mistake  kyle and his allies -- jan ors an alliance soldier; qu rahn assisting you from beyond the grave; and wee gee the family droid -- are all archetypes cut from the star wars cloth which is nothing but a good thing in my mind  the dark jedi on the other hand -- jerec a twisted and evil former jedi from the old republic; sariss a cold calculating perfectionist; maw a hateful being whose rage fuels his power; boc a warped and clearly insane twi'lek; pic and gorc a bizarre set of twins like you've never seen; and yun the youngest and best of the bunch -- are almost all inspired by the title characters from akira kurosawa's classic film the seven samuraithe settings are just what you'd expect full of atmosphere that could've been lifted directly from the movies  nar shaddaa is like hong kong in space with buildings crammed together without planning  sulon is a pastoral agrarian world at least where it isn't under the empire's heel  and the valley of the jedi and its tombs evoke are so rich with history you can almost hear the spirits of the jedi speaking to you in the hallways of the burial groundsalso packaged in this bundle is the one and only expansion pack for it mysteries of the sith  it's set five years after the events of jedi knight which naturally assumes you chose the light side  you play as kyle again in the first few missions who's taken on an apprentice -- mara jade a character introduced in timothy zahn's star wars books from 1991-1993 (heir to the empire dark force rising and the last command)  after that first batch of missions kyle goes off to chase down a lead leaving you controlling mara for the remainder of the game  you take missions aiding both the fledgling new republic and the newly-rebuilt jedi order until you travel to a forgotten sith temple to rescue kyle from the dark sideand from himselfwhile sith had a few flaws -- why would kyle have to re-learn force abilities he already had  why not say who the sith were instead of just dangling the name around -- i did like the setting of the sith temple  this place is genuinely creepy where the spirits of the dead know no rest and never will  i also liked how they handled the ending duel  it's audacious and it fits in perfectly with the jedi precepts  it's also so simple that you'd never think of iti recommend this game as heartily now as i would've eight years ago  it's a low-tech game so it's practically guaranteed to run on whatever rig you have  and because it's been out for so long you can pick it up for a fraction of the price of the current gamesbuy this game  it's worth a lot more than you'll pay for it\",\n",

       " 'lucas arts has come out with some notable fiascos over the past few years as far as games are concerned force commander x-wing vs tie fighter (which is only good in multiplayer) starfighter etc this is one of thier outings that i actually would rate at 4 1/2 stars and is one of the most misunderstood and underrated games to come out of george lucas\\'s computer game brainchildthe premise is simple you are given control of either the empire under emperor palpatine or the rebel alliance under mon mothma if you start out as the imperials you\\'ll get a significant advantage in technology and capital ships as well as more developed worldsplus you have a bonafide jedi in darth vader who can detect and train jedi students as he discovers them making these officers even more valuable (more on this later) the rebels start off with 2nd rate capital ships and planets that are far flung for the most part thier base is moveable and under the circumstances that\\'s a good thing since part of the imperials\\' goals is to destroy the rebel basei\\'ll try to simplify this game but it\\'s not an easy task depending upon the size of the galaxy you have picked (small medium huge etc) your goal is to colonize planets and develop them use diplomacy to introduce other cultures either into the rebellion or the empire or outright conquer enemy planets these planets can then be equipped with varying tools to make use of thier inherent commoditiesfor instance one planet might have multiple shipyards for building your navy while others might be resource sytems used only for mining and maintaining your credit flow characters in the game each have inherent usessome can do ship research others can be used for diplomacy while others can be sent to sabotage enemy worlds and ships if the character has been detected to be a force user then a jedi knight or master can begin to train them resulting in a character with increased scores for thier particular specialty in addition characters can be places in positions of authority either in fleets or on planets admiral ackbar can lead one fleet while lando calrissian can general it thus resulting in your fleets doing more damage and taking less hits in battlesresearch is a lot of fun and can be begun almost from the beginning in one of three areas ship research (new ship designs fighters etc) building design (new planetary shields improved shipyards) and troop design (dark troopers sullastan regiments) typically whoever has a leg up in research has an easier time controlling the game and it\\'s highly recommended that if you find any npc\\'s (wedge antilles can do ship research bevel lemelisk can do all three types)to start asapthe part everyone wants to know about though is the gigantic ship battles and man they can get epic there\\'s nothing like seeing 100 rebel ships do battle with the same number of imperial ones and engagements can run up to 30 minutes the graphics of these battles are a little dated by today\\'s standards but still seeing a calamari cruiser turn sideways to exchange broadsides with a star destroyer is a sight to see fighters swarm around the whole time sniping at enemy fighters or helping engage the big capital ships there\\'s different options for your ships to maneuver into position for attacks but as far as i can see they\\'re for the most part pointless as both fleets typically run straight for the other and begin duking it outsingle player is fun but gets dreary after a while especially if you\\'re playing as the rebels the imperials generally name thier ships at the beginning but the database for ship names must be shallow because soon after you\\'ll start seeing such inspiring names as \"carrack cruiser 152\" or \"star destroyer 43\" and the most glaring deficiency in single player mode is that the imperials will *never* build a death star ever leading me to want to shout \"the death star plans are not in the main computer\"this game becomes sterling in multiplayer though and if you ever wanted to play a strategy game on an almost epic level this is definitely a game you want to check out a human will almost invariably play by different strategies than the computer will and oftentimes you\\'ll find different and sometimes very unique methods employed for winning my brother tends to build zillions of fighters on each planet he owns making capital ship conquest almost impossible to accomplish without matching the number of fighters in your own fleet my nephew builds heavily into capital ships with a mixed escort screen basically heavy on planetary bombardment i tend to make a mixture of the two aiming for a well rounded task force and when turn 5000 hits and you\\'re still grappling for control of the galaxy with your opponent well let\\'s say that it never wears down on you if ever you get a chance to build a death star do it it is an incredible rush to build one secretly moving it suddenly and unexpectedly into your opponents main manufacturing planets\\' orbit and then hitting \"destroy planet\" watching half of his shipbuilding capability go up in a blaze of smoke and rubbleunless you have a lan at home and know someone who wants to try this gem of a game out the only place you\\'ll be able to play is on gamespy and internet gaming zone but expect games to be *very* long and drawn out sometimes lasting as much as a week depending upon how often you have to save and reloadthe mediocrity of the single player game is more than made up for in multiplayer trust me and grab a copy and see for yourself :)',\n",

       " 'besides being the latest (and likely last) of the x-wing games \"alliance\" is also the best - bringing the series back from the hole it sat in after \"x-wing v tie fighter\" to the epic trail blazed by the original \"tie fighter\"  the real question though is whether its improvements make it worth getting to players who bought the older gamesunlike the older x-wing games you don\\'t start out as a fighter pilot or even with alliance (or imperials for \"tie fighter\" owners)  instead you belomg to a family-run intergalactic shipping business plying lawless tracts of space  in a time of civil war your family tries to stay neutral even as it\\'s split along pro-rebel and imperial-loyalist sides (guess which side you\\'re on)  despite its seemingly civilian trappings interstellar freight forwarding involves a lot of space combat - you\\'re armed with turbo-lasers and ion-cannon and equipped with deflectors  though you won\\'t face imperials immediately combat will come quickly - forcing you to fend off the viraxo your family\\'s hostile rivals  as the war progresses the viraxo leap to the empire\\'s side forcing you to the rebellion and trade your corellian freighter for an x-wing fighter  until then the game offers a series of missions that evolve from tutorial to modest test to more intense combat  you\\'ll likely already have the skills needed if you\\'ve played the older sw fighter\\'s games but these also set up the back story  (on an interesting note sci-fi fans may note a resemblance between the viraxo fighters and the angel fighters from \"captain scarlet\")  the game climaxes with the epic battle of endor in which you take on the 2nd death star from the inside (in a mission i like to refer to as \"operation watch-that-overpass\")  as in older games you fly alongside and against ai pilots though they\\'re more chatty than before (including a motor-mouthed droid named m-kay who makes c3po sound positively mute) making the dialog sound more natural than it should  (that is until you\\'ve replayed the mission a few times and it all starts to get old)\"alliance\" is a mixed bag of hits and misses  ties to the original \"x-wing\" of 1994 are painfully clear in terms of graphics and gameplay - this is still about flying canned missions in linear order in which you must complete by fulfilling a set of specific and not infrequently counter-intuitive goals (ie no matter how many tie fighters you swat down all lambda shuttles must dock with the medical frigate; all correlian cruisers must survive; you must inspect every container; etc)  counterintuitive mission goals guarantee that you\\'ll fly even moderately challenging missions more than oncegraphics and sound are up-to-date - the date unfortunately being 1999  the big news is that you can now pad-lock those enemies or mission-critical craft - which is great not only for improving your situational awareness but also because you can view the insides of your ship\\'s flight-deck (this is a huge leap over previous games which essentially gave you 2-d renderings of the same flight panels we\\'ve seen since 1994)  while shading and lensing effects are also added i usually get too focused on the enemy to really appreciate them  i\\'m also not enough of an audiophile to comment on the sound though the sound effects and john williams score remain as expectedly faithful to the films as we\\'ve come to expect (though on my xp machine the soundtrack tended to get hung if the mission lasted too long)  the mission areas seem larger and you now seem to have even larger numbers of enemies to fight against (clouds of fighters instead of just swarms)  also you may now have to zoom into different areas (via hyperspace buoy) in a single mission - although i just find that increases the chances of running into bugs that make missions unwinnable  also failure to achieve goals in one of the mission areas means that you\\'ll have to re-fly the entire mission set againthe game\\'s most revolutionary improvement isn\\'t technical at all - relying on a story that (at first) makes you more than just another faceless rebel flyboy  (looks like somebody at \"totally games\" fired up a copy of the orginal \"tie fighter\" and was reminded why that game was so much more popular then \"x-wing\")  instead your fight is for survival against greedy competitors soon to become a personal vendetta against the empire  characters you meet between missions including m-kay and other vengeful relatives advance the plot and keep it focused throughout successive missions  even when you join the alliance you\\'ll still be asked to handle some family business  if anything the story could have kept you out of the rebellion a bit longer or at least made the transition a tad smoother - the story loses something once you become a rebel pilot though manages to hold onto you anyway  other notable improvements - besides fighters you can also fly armed freighters in the class of the millenium falcon or another class of ship that looks like a souped up version of the mf  to add to the complexity you can turn over the actual flying and man your gun turrets or set turrets to defensive fire - while that reduces the laser fire you can devote on targets you attack while flying it\\'s another example of how the game challenges you by forcing you to allocate your limited in-flight resources  other new wrinkles - as a freighter you can pick up cargo which makes for interesting missions retrieving contraband from a combat zone  (in an early mission you\\'ve got to snatch a container of warheads from a space station under attack by a star destroyer - the way the mission is structured you can\\'t retrieve until near the end of the mission when the station is about to explode)most pc\\'s should run this game without problems  i played it on my p4 having few winxp compatibility problems (sound among them)  the game also supports rudder pedals - for rolling maneuvers such as those used by scores of tie fighters  in short an x-wing battle-sim that\\'s guaranteed to please though obviously pleasing most those who\\'ve never tried one before',\n",

       " 'starcraft was released years before i am writing this review but is still one of the most fun games i\\'ve ever played actually this is one out of two of the only games i\\'ve ever rated as a 5-star game on amazoncom if you\\'re reading this you\\'re obviously looking into buying this game and finding out what it\\'s about and such starcraft has so many dimensions that after years of playin im still addicted to the gamebasically starcraft is a game that uses the same type of formula found in a warcraft or age of empires type of game - you build a colony of units and buildings and attack your opponent starcraft lets you chooese from 3 races - terran the human like race zerg the larva infested race or protos the highly evolved computer generated race all of these races have units - all with there pros and cons for example a zerg gaurdian can take out a whole terran defense of missle turrets but it cant attack air unitssc\\'s first mode is single player where choose your colony and you go through a campaign for each race learning more about the wars of the races and having fun while doing it also in single player mode you can play a custom match to practice your skills against the computer overall the gameplay is great but there seems to be one flaw a term called rushing where the opposing team can take out in early colony in a matter of minutes they can easily \"rush\" into your base (mainly protoss zealots and terran marines) and attack you qucik enough to kill you and destroy all of your buildings while your still just getting started the blizzard team tried to slow down \"rushing\" by making updates to the game and making it so that a user can only take 12 units at a time while retreating attacking etc but it hasn\\'t worked out to wellanother mode (which is where you have alot of fun) is multiplayer mode where you go online and play with other people from around the us asia uk (or wherever you live) once you enter multiplayer mode you\\'ll have to pick a name and password once you\\'re done with that you\\'ll be put into a chatroom which is a great part to the game when you dont feel like playing or if you just want to make friends in the game this feature has it you can edit your bdy lists here send friends messages etc (basically the whole aim sceanrio) another thing you can do in chatrooms is see how much your lagging (which ill explain in a minute) lagging is when your computer is to slow to keep up with the connection and u make everybody suffer from your slow computer dont worry though people who dont have slow computers can drop slow players disrupting a game and game creaters can boot slow people or lagging players or anyone they want in multiplayer mode can choose forom a variety of types of games from a comp stomp where you can =d a bunch of other people take on 1 to 6 or 7 computers to 3v3 no clutter games and even down to 4v4 nr20min (nr= no rush but some people still dont listen to the rules) in a multiplayer game you can ally in an ffa (free for all) bs (backstab) and so on this adds demension to the game making it harder to know who to trust and who to believe games with diffrent rules and games called ums are made by starcraft players in the campaign editor mode that\\'s right you can make your own game on sc all of them are fun for the most part but some ums games you may never be good atcampaign editor is the final mode in the game i\\'ve never realy explored it too much because i never wanted to make a bad game and then people tell me its a bad game lol in campaign editor you basically make your own ums game its fun to a certain degree but i personally never got into itall in all starcraft is a fine release by blizzard a classic game of its time that even today has thousands and thousands of players on them game at a time hope you go and buy it cause it\\'s really cheap now and it\\'s good',\n",

       " \"i heard that this game had garnered a good reputation but until now it had never piqued my interest there are so many games in the real-time strategy genre - you have classics like age of empires 2 and command &amp;  conquer or total stinkers like tiberian sunit's important to remember  that starcraft was created at least two years before age of empires 2 it's  obvious that aoe2 borrowed some good ideas from starcraft the main one  being those of unit limits in starcraft you have a 200 unit limit so it's  still possible to build a huge army but you also have to balance that  against the number of units you use to gather resourcesanother unique  feature of starcraft is the totally different sides it absolutely amazes  me that a single game can have such diverse armies and yet still manage to  be so well balanced there isn't a single unit in the game that can't be  neutralised by another unit - which is no mean feat considering how  powerful they arethe most interesting aspect to these units are their  special abilities certain units in each race have special attacks they can  use to neutralise or destroy an opponent for instance the terran ghost  soldier can fire an emp blast that can knock out mechanical units zerg  queens can fire parasites which attach themselves to enemies allowing you  to see whatever that unit sees the protoss have the templar a unit that  uses a chain lightning `psionic storm' to eliminate whole squadrons of  unitsthere are certain features which i wish had been implemented it's  not possible to control the behaviour of your units (ie setting them to  guard or defensive mode etc) this makes it entirely possible for your  entire massed army to chase after a single unit when really you want them  to stay in one place fortunately a `hold' command is provided but i  still would've preferred to give my units more advanced commandsthe  other annoying aspect is map size it's blindingly obvious that the maps  are too small when compared to the size of the units try leading a group  through a narrow canyon - because there is so little room individual units  will often take a different path to get to a destinationstarcraft's  other strength is in it's storyline i have never seen such powerfully  realized characters like this in a computer game in truth there are no  real good guys or bad guys in this game everybody has their own  motivations for their actions the sequential compaign design only  strengthens this aspect it's unfortunate that tiberian sun's michael biehn  and james earl jones didn't have a script like this to play within  conclusion starcraft is everything that command &amp; conquer: tiberian  sun wasn't it has the best designed units of any strategy game it has a  strong storyline which is beautifully realised in the single-player  missions and the addition of staredit means you can create your own  missions once you tire of the blizzard approved ones no wonder why this  game has stood the test of time however the omission of advanced unit  controls mean i have to deduct one star\",\n",

       " 'this is a retro game - no way around ithowever i actually enjoy retro games  i actually just got done playing another world and fallout 1 & 2 on my laptophaving been playing alot of desktop tower defense games lately i thought i would upgrade to a true rts game  starcraft kept coming up high on everyone\\'s favorite list so i thought i\\'d give it a trythe good:- this really is a fun game  i\\'m only on level 9 (out of 30) on the original but it\\'s fun  level 8 took me about 4 hrs to finally beat  but some of this is because there\\'s no instructions in the game (see the bad)  after reading the strategy guide for the level i finally figured out what i needed to do  however i had fun playing the whole time without getting discouraged- the graphics aren\\'t all that bad  i was expecting much worse  though they\\'re not bad they\\'re not great either  about the same as fallout 1  i am surprised they haven\\'t been improved by a patch- no easy/medium/hard setting  i actually prefer to not have an easy/medium/hard setting  on some games my first instinct is to pick medium but then i will often get stuck or find it\\'s too easy  and then i wish i had picked something different  this game you have to really be strategic  some levels may be too easy and some may be pretty darn hard  if they\\'re hard simply refer to the guide  which brings up another point  you don\\'t have to keep playing a level until you demolish the cpu  you just need to win  i tried out middle earth rts and your people carry over  i got a few levels in and couldn\\'t beat the level  after hitting a forum i found out it\\'s impossible to win if you didn\\'t max out your army from the previous levelsthe bad:-  video  i run this on my laptop and the screen turns black and the game starts in the upper left part of the window consuming only about 25% of my widescreen laptop  the rest of the screen is black  it\\'s pefectly playable but awefully small  however i noticed that when i put my laptop in my docking station connected to an external monitor it goes full-screen  of course full-screen on a 24\" widescreen monitor is not good for this game either  no amount of tweaking to the shortcut seemed to help  the only option is to change the desktop resolution to 800x600 before starting the game which is a major pain  some googling and it seems most everyone with a widescreen laptop experiences this  they all refer to a freeware download that let\\'s you run starcraft in a window  this actually works very nice and was surprised at how much i liked it compared to the smaller screen in the upper left  however there\\'s comments from some users that after using the program some people have been banned from battlenet since it saw they were using a 3rd party program with starcraft  i\\'m not interested in playing sc on battlenet so that\\'s not a huge deal for me  but really if you\\'re going to actively sell a game at the game shops you would think this would be fixed by blizzard  it\\'s one thing if i found this at a used/discount store but i didn\\'t  also i\\'m surprised blizzard hasn\\'t released a patch to smooth out the graphics a bit  it\\'s not horrible but it\\'s hard to imagine that it would be too hard to fix it up a little better with a patch  many other games have patches that improve the graphics  doom quake to name a couple- no instructions  really  no instructions  the strategy guide helps and the first levels help give you a feel for the game but really  no instructions  this is part of what hurt me on level 8  i wanted to beat it without having to read the strategy guide  in the end the guide told me what units i should have before i attack and some of them i had never used let alone knew how to useend rating:  4 stars  i\\'m having fun and that\\'s what counts for a retro game  minus 1 star since i have to use 3rd party freeware to get it to run in a window or proportioned correctly on my laptop',\n",

and they'll  run for cover and regroup with their pals let the marines see or hear you  and they'll drop a hand grenade on your head ninja's don't just run into  you they jump over your head and land behind you crabs pop up at the most  inconvenient times a well designed level and a poorly designed level is  differentiated by the &quot;intelligence&quot; of the enemies although the  modifications are great they are certainly predictable to an extent play  the game enough and you'll eventually spot patterns to the enemies  &quot;thinking&quot;so of course after defeating the game forward and  backwards it would be time to test the quake engine network code needless  to say a 56k modem is not recommended even though with my experience the  network game play is better than the unreal engine the modem does this  game sad justice hopping up to anything better than a 56k modem really  makes this game shine valve has multi-player levels packed right in with  this game nice big areas with lots of weapons make this game a fun  &quot;frag-fest&quot; the levels don't have that disgusting  &quot;dark&quot; feel to them underground levels have suitable colors and  lighting out door levels have an expansive feeling (although no where near  the &quot;out door&quot; feeling that unreal does so well) too bad that  h-l has compatibility problems with various video cardsit's really not  so much compatibility problems it's really more that valve's default  settings for the are usually not the correct settings (the voodoo video  family suffers the worst from this) by default the video gamma is far too  bright for the voodoo 2 card the decals have the incorrect value lighting  don't appear correctly and sli seems to have an odd effect on the game  most cards have their unique set of problems and all of these adjustments  have to be done at the command level not something to be done by the  average gamerand this game screams to be played by all gamers with  many advanced gamers using the enclosed software developer's kit (sdk) and  worldcraft to make new levels and in some cases completely new games  valve guaranteed h-l's place in the gaming community even if the average  player has no idea how to use the software to create new levels they can  still go to numerous web sites and download any number of home made levels  the  opposing force expansion pack and the upcoming gunman game are direct  descendants of users and their valve's sdk that are purchasable in the  store while hot downloads like they hunger and dss darkstar add free  life to the gamethis leads up to the final gripe with h-l though not a  major one i have the team fortress classic (tfc) expansion the opposing  force pack and numerous &quot;user made&quot; levels and my directory  continues to grow currently the space taken by h-l and the various packs  levels and extras has reached 912 mb of space in contrast diablo 2 (full  installation) is 110 gb while diablo 1 is only 101 mb the game's are  growing guys and gals so the pc requirements should be followed like a  bibleall in all i would have given more than five stars if the system  would have allowed me to do so but i admit i had to take at least one star  away i did this to force a point onto most people who wish to own a copy  of h-l the game can be played right of the box but to get the full effect  of the game you're going to need to edit the auto start and configuration  files voodoo 2 owners used to have the h-l voodoo doctor but alas i have  not seen his web page in months h-l really does not like the voodoo card  ati rage fury does a little better but you'll get a bizarre  &quot;ghost&quot; on occasion the tnt family does the best out of the  bunch with the default values i understand valve is working on this issue  in h-l 2 (tfc 2)  but we'll have to wait and see congrats valve this  game shoved quake quake 2 unreal and duke nukem 3d permanently off of my  drive i've since gotten a dual 13 gb drive configuration (26 gb total)  i've never even bothered to dust off those games with the purchase of  bungee software by microsoft (please god don't let halo and oni be x-box  only games)  the multi-player nature of quake 3 and duke nukem (with the  unreal engine) on a perpetual release date h-l will be a tough game to  knock off the &quot;game of the year&quot;

this is despite a more effective damage model in \"secret weapons of the luftwaffe\" (1990) in which a given hit from an enemy will lead to progressive deterioration in your plane\\'s condition  ground targets and ships are completely implausible - one hit from your rockets and destroyers u-boats and merchantmen (which remain parked like sitting ducks) disappear in fireballs ala \"battlestar galactica\" which hints that this project was rushed to shelves  (the other hint is the appearance of me-262 jets - they only appear in one mission and as ground targets  how did that happen)so what\\'s really wrong  a weak mission generator and the same aircraft we\\'ve seen in over ten years in flight sims  ms probably guessed that it wasn\\'t worth their time to do more than add guns and damage models to the fs engine - people would just download the missions flight panels scenery or aircraft files they wanted anyway  sure the game has the big planes of that theater of the war - but then did cfs1 have to wartime europe  with its flight engine cfs1 would have been the perfect vehicle for a korean war sim - an idea that ms inexplicably ignored for this and the next 2 additions  wwii europe simply has been simmed to death  terrain is incredibly flat and especially down low doesn\\'t even look like terrain  it\\'s almost at the point where unless you go on the `net for add-on files there really isn\\'t anything to simulate here  in short ms was hot to create a military flight sim that would adapt to any user\\'s preference they forgot to give it features that people would prefer to keep  i couldn\\'t get decent performance on my p200mmx/voodoo2 pc  obviously hardware wasn\\'t an issue when i moved up to a p4 (no windows xp compatibility issues here)on a final note cfs1\\'s disappointments are not completely covered by cfs2  i own both games since i wanted a pacific war sim  though cfs2 is obviously an improvement cfs1 holds up pretty well - cfs1 owners can download or buy add-on files to capture the pacific experience  in short if you\\'ve got cfs1 don\\'t feel like you\\'ve got to spend $$ for cfs2 or to upgrade your machine',\n",

       " \"i don't really know where to begin but perhaps a good place to start would be to discuss the in-depth story this game has  there is a series of books based off of this game  sid meier's as a company in my opinion did not do enough to hype this game because this game is so much better than civilization  it's like civilization of the future  they should take this game and add it to the civilization as a future technology expansion like have different planets you could zoom into and run  isn't that really the next step for civilization anyways  mars  alpha centauri  the moon  ect  lol  there are a few things you have to get used to in this game like for example you can customize yor units with different armor weapons ect and they build fast/slower depending on how much they cost ect  so you see how it can get a little tricky but you can leave everything standard if you want  like i said this game has tons of depth and in my opinion is better than civilzation 4 (which i have and am not happy with)  civ 4 is too much hype and not enough game play  it's fun but alpha centauri just does it better  this game draws you in and keeps you telling yourself 'just one more turn'  until 8 hours have gone by and you're thinking to yourself 'just one more turn'  lol  i don't know what else to say about this game except i'm hoping to acquire the expansion pack and i hope that sid meier's gets a clue and makes a 2nd version of this game\",\n",

       " 'i\\'m sure if you\\'ve been looking at this game you\\'ve probably also played the civilization series  this game has a similar blueprint to civilation but at the same time is quite differentit starts off as your average civ-building game with the five crashed faction colonies setting up separately  as one of the faction leaders you have particular bonuses  you start off with a town a couple technologies and you\\'re off and running trying to build up your tech tree economy military and lots of citiesinstead of barbarians though you\\'re fighting worm-like lifeforms with \"psionic\" attack abilities that can bypass your normal defenses  in time you can learn to defend better against them and even harness these capabilities yourself which makes an intriguing extra layer to the combat here  these worms also figure into somewhat of an overarching storyline as well as told through various dream sequences your faction leader has throughoutone great thing about this game is how you can create your entirely own units  for example if you don\\'t like the design vehicle unit with the antimatter weapons and speed upgrade you can run to the prototyope shop and swap those out with psionic weapons and the ability to paradrop (so long as you have the right technologies)  plus not only can you upgrade the weapons and armor on just about any unit you\\'ve already built but you can swap it out for different bonus abilities (such as paradrop) though all for a price  this leaves you with the ability to have the upgrade and alter all the units at your desposal to your needs rather than on regular civ games where you might get stuck with a useless cavalry unit because you can\\'t upgrade it into a tankthe best part may be how immersive it is  alpha centauri boasts leaders with unique personalities that shape how you interact with one another  whenever you research a technology it features original quotes by these leaders (and occasionally by other less important figures) that can be funny enlightening and possibly even mind-boggling  add to that a veritable storyline that has different outcomes based on the methods you use to beat the game and it is probably the most creative and fully-realized fictional universe put into a strategy settinghaving replayed it recently the only drawback i can find with this game is the ai  while not necessarily bad once i got used to the game mechanics again the ai is just a bit too easy even on the highest difficulty setting  i don\\'t know if thats because the ai hasn\\'t aged well or i just played this game so much that i know it inside and out not to mention help from all the other strategy games i\\'ve had practice with in the intervening yearslong story short: this is the most memorable civilization game and probably even strategy game altogether i have ever played  definitely worth a look if you can find it for a decent price',\n",

       " 'i\\'ve owned this game for many years so long i don\\'t even remember  pre-2000 to the best of my memory this game occurred when sid and the civ people were having a bit of falling out so sid moved to fireaxis and produced this game which built into it many of the \"improvements\" that he forsaw for civ it was in some ways a \"pointer\" to civ iii and some of the changes to occur therebeing a 1999 game it has \"primitive\" graphics no 3d etc as in today\\'s games but i still think they\\'re decent also like civ ii this is not a half-hour game it can go on for some time but at least you can save it and pick it up laterit does occur \"beyond civ\" after the launch of the spaceship and colonization of space and involves a new set of \"races\" and a new tech tree some call the tech tree \"too foreign\" or hard to understand but i don\\'t really think so the techs may seem \"artificial\" or \"invented\" while the civ tech\\'s seem \"real\" that is techs based on things we are familiar with to me they are just a ladder to climb to more advanced capabilities wonders (called \"special projects) social options units etcthe game can be won through diplomacy conquest transcendence (sort of a human-evolution event) economics cooperative and many rules can be turned \"on/off\" and \"iron man\" modefurther there is major flexibility in choosing not only governments but also economics military education environment (big factor in this game) research health etc and you can take \"stances\" ruthless moderate or idealistic for military interactions  trade still can play a big role toothis is not a war game (though it can be played that way) instead it is an influence and strategy game without being too longwinded i think its strong points are (relative to civ ii)* you can use the \"governor\" much better including customizing it to your own rules as opposed to the governor in civ which i don\\'t know anyone who uses (including unit automations) these are especially useful in  to reduce the tedium in the ics (infinite city sprawl) and \"pop-booming\" strategies often employed where there may be many many cities* strategic deallings with other civ\\'s are crucial to a successful game* boundaries (or areas of influence) are introduced these help \"manage\" war/peace and some of the really annoying situations in civ ii* you can set ingame \"slants\" on the governor as you progress through appropriate \"play styles\" of explore discover build and conquer you have to be prepared to play any of them depending on game circumstances* there are major improvements in automation beyond just the governor and \"slants\" such as using queue\\'s for building and \"group\" commands like \"build road to\" instead of having to go tile by tile to do it the goto command is improved too complete with mod\\'s like \"avoid enemies\" etc* instead of a lot of units the units instead are basic but extensive mods can be researched and added to basic units to form new capabilities this helps avoid the \"warrior vs machinegun syndrome\"* all units can be upgraded for a fee this is more realistic than the \"throwaways\" or needing \"leo\\'s workshop\" wonder* materials don\\'t have to be in the city to use it they can be \"teleported\" to other cities from one city or from a distant location if you can control the landwell you get the idea its just a lot of new stuff :)i don\\'t particularly like the huge differences among the races some of which have such constraints that they are virtually impossible to win a game with only 4 or so really lend themselves to playable games but i don\\'t think this is a \"game stopper\" just a constraint it would be nice if some of the traits could be modified to more balance the game but i truly think they were created to be a foil to the human player as you play you can use the \"social engineering\" for some balancingthe game is richly complex with numerous \"in-play\" options mod\\'s and social structures etc that can give play variationsall in all i find it to be a game offering many enjoyable hours though it is hard to \"force it\" to play your play style you instead have to probe for play styles that fit the nature of the challenges of your particular game i still find myself playing this now and then even 10 years after it\\'s releaseit can be purchased now for the $10-15 range including shipping i\\'d say its a definite option at those prices',\n",

       " \"first off some background  i am not a nice guy  i do not say nice things about games just to avoid hurting people's feelings  if you don't believe me check out reviews of some of the games i've trashed like might  and magic 8  so when i tell you that this game is by far the best rpg i've  ever seen believe me some of the things i liked about it:a genuinely  non-linear story line:  starting with character developement you can take  radically different paths through the game  most of the situations in the  game can be resolves in several different ways all of which lead to  different outcomes with different effects on the world and the npc's  you  can also choose which side to support in several different political  fightsthe best npc system ever:  the npc's in the game are extremely  well written and seem to have lives and goals of their own  their  dialogue is well written and gives each one a unique voice  and some of  the political maneuvering that they are involved in is really quite  complicated  they seemed more like the characters in a novel than the  cardboard cut outs i usually see in rpg's the game's conversation system  is one of the nicest features  basically your character's intelligence  determines how many things he can think of to say in any given situation  this means that a smooth talking smart character will have a different set  of options than a dim witted combat machine  it's a nice system that works  very wellthe game world is totally awesome  it's gloomy  post-apocolyptic but totally cool  the game designers really put some  time in on coming up with interesting settings  i rarely use the phrase  &quot;sense of wonder&quot; in conjunction with a computer game but time  and again i came across situations and settings that really blew me away  also the game world reflects a more adult understanding of human nature  than any other game out there  the amount of thought they put into the  political situations social structures and personal rivalries is really  quite impressiveinteresting fights: unlike most rpg's which have  thousands of fights against a huge number of unintelligent opponents  fallout 2 tends to have fewer more interesting fights  (or at least it  can  a real blood and guts player who charges into every situation with  guns blazing could still generate a lot of carnage) a particularly nice  feature is the &quot;outdoorsman&quot; skill which lets you spot random  encounters in the badlands and avoid them if you want  this means that  players who want to get in a rumble can do so while those who just want to  get on with the story can save the timereal choice in character  generation:  simply put you can't have a character that can do it all  even with huge amounts of experience  hence you've gotta make some hard  choices and play those out  the game is very different depending on  whether you choose to play a smooth talker a stealthy type or a combat  machinea clean quick combat engine:  the combat system is flexible  enough to generate some very interesting tactical situations but clean  enough to run pretty quickly  given the lethality of the weapons involved  most fights end in less than five rounds so every move is critical it's a  nice break from some of the thirty round slug fests that go on in games  like might and magic 7\",\n",

       " '\"railroad tycoon ii\" is the 1998 sequel to the 1990 classic \"sid meier\\'s railroad tycoon\" even though sid\\'s name has jumped ship this is a solid sequel to a great game the premise is simple enough: build a railroad buy some trains ship stuff from where it is to where it\\'s needed get richfrom humble concepts mighty games are grown and enriching this basic idea are things like: train quality which forces you to choose between [cost] fast good on slopes or reliable; keeping demand high by supplying only small amounts versus the cost of connecting other places where demand is high; short routes with small payloads and fast turnarounds versus long routes with big payloads; buying and selling stocks to take advantage of economic trends; buying the businesses whose materials you\\'re transporting; defending against train robbers or hiring shady characters and exploiting legal loopholes; and so onbasically this premise works and supplies hours of good addictive fun there\\'s a lot of replay value as well since you can take a different approach to each game the graphics are (still even in 2003) pleasant and communicative and the sound is mostly good the scenarios are pretty challenging without (for the most part) being crushingly hard and the three levels of victories encourages replay as you try to \"go for the gold\"the are a number of hitches unfortunately the manual and tutorial are really inadequate--which tends to sting given that most of the fan-supplied data on the web is gone the supply-and-demand process is actually somewhat opaque (i did figure it out but it took me a while and some research on the \\'net) your board of directors is very gullible not able to look ahead even a month (this makes them easy to manipulate) the stock market stuff makes it easy to lose with a thriving railroad and doesn\\'t add much to the game that i\\'ve experiencedfurther trains really only go from point a to point b that is say you have cattle yard (b) that needs grain and two grain farms (a1 and a2) that supply grain you can\\'t set up a train to pick up grain at a1 travel to a2 to pick up more grain and then travel to b to drop it off when the train stops it\\'s completely unloaded this is never spelled out anywhere and certain ways of setting up a train\\'s route suggest otherwise but in the above situation your train will actually unload grain at a grain farm (for no money) rather than haul it another ten miles to the cattle yard where it\\'s actually neededthe scale of the game is such that each train moves about 1/50th-1/100th of its actual speed in other words a trip that should take a week takes a year this is probably a necessary abstraction(train-model fans will want to keep in mind that this game has nothing to do with their hobby) but it has the effect of exaggerating every mistake or mishap jesse james didn\\'t just rob a single train he robbed your entire route for the yearall of this detracts a bit but it\\'s a testament to the strength of the concept and execution that this would still be a five-star game even with these issues the killer--the thing that made me subtract a star--is the track-laying interface it\\'s really easy to lay track you didn\\'t mean to there\\'s no undo it actually costs you to remove it the way the ui figures out the smoothest route is dubious and there\\'s really no decent handling for the fact that finding the smoothest track is best done at the closest zoom while finding the shortest route is best done at the furthest zoomcoupled with some bugs that make stations seem disconnected you can end up in a situation where you lose a game because the track-laying interface was not up to the task and that\\'s the only =real= sour lemon in this package again though even with this there\\'s still a lot of funit\\'ll definitely whet your apetite for \"railroad tycoon 3\"',\n",

       " \"_sanitarium_ opens with a movie:  a man on his way home from work calls his wife with the news that he has &quot;the answer&quot;  next thing you know his car flies off the road he wakes up in an institution his face swathed in bandages with no idea who he is where he is or how he got there  of course this is exactly what he -- and you as the player -- must now find out_sanitarium_ is a really great old-style 3rd person adventure game that combines an intriguing story with interesting puzzles a spooky atmosphere and pretty decent graphics for its time in its nine levels you visit various parts of the asylum a huge insect hive a scary circus and other places all steeped in the main character's personal mythology  each level not only has its own internal continuity but is connected to the larger story by threads of symbol and dream logic  i found this fascinating and extremely well done  it was one of the things that kept me wanting to play even when it was late at night and my eyes couldn't focus any more--something i haven't experienced with a game in a whilethe puzzles are a pretty good variety:  some inventory some conversation some mechanical  most are pretty easy once you find what you're looking for but there are a couple of frustrating pixel hunts where it's possible to miss the one thing you need to move on  also sometimes the inventory which flashes when it can be used has to be positioned in exactly the right place  there are also a few action sequences and you can die  usually i really object to this in adventure games but _sanitarium_ handles the action the way it should be handled:  the sequences are pretty straightforward if you die you get to start again at the beginning of the sequence without going through a tedious &quot;you failed&quot; ending sequence or reloading from page one you have infinite lives and the pieces of the puzzle you have managed to solve stay solved so you don't have to repeat what you've already done over and over  take a tip from this game designersnavigation is a little awkward to start -- you interact using the left mouse button and move using the right -- but you get used to that quickly enough the main problem is that the character can get sucked into things like stairs so you spend a lot of time going back and forth (or i did anyway)  another problem is that sometimes you have to have your character in exactly the right spot before he'll do what he's supposed to  if he's not close enough he'll say &quot;i can't do that (or some variation thereof)&quot;  except for sometimes when he'll walk over and complete the action on his own  i found no rhyme or reason to this and it got a bit annoying in placesthe graphics are mid-nineties graphics:  3rd person 2-d  so if you can't appreciate a game that doesn't have all the latest bells and whistles you won't appreciate this one there are some really gruesome scenes not for the faint of heart or stomach the voice acting is mostly pretty good but in some places character voices were hard to understand  there are subtitles though so that wasn't a problem  other sound f/x were well-done being suited to the various environments yet not too repetetive or demanding of attentioni completed _sanitarium_ in about 30 hours  if i had a complaint it was that the ending was a little rushed and i felt that all the gaps in the story hadn't been filled in  still compared to the bulk of games that are being released today this is a great find and a worthwhile buy  if you like older adventures _sanitarium_ is a must\",\n",

       " 'when gamers talk about a game which redefines a genre of games \"thief\" is the type of game they mean it\\'s not just playing the same sort of game in a new way it\\'s taking the core concept of a genre and going in a completely different direction it makes a new game out of a familiar concept in one elegant stroke \"thief\" takes the concept of the first-person shooter and completely flips it around greatly expanding the potential of what an fps game can beimagine if you will a first-person shooter in which it is not necessary to kill everything and everyone who crosses your path there are a few like that \"thief\" takes it a step further though \"killing is messy\" says your character at one point while playing the game in expert mode a stated goal of many of the missions is specifically not to kill anyone rather than heavy weaponry and the adrenaline rush of charging an infinite horde of beasties the goal in \"thief\" is subterfuge subtlety and patience most especially patiencethe game is also quite replayable by choosing different playing styles for yourself some players choose to play by not killing or knocking anyone out at all except when a mission requires it which is rarely though i myself have not yet played through the game this way i can see the challenge and fun it would presentthat\\'s not to say you can\\'t fight in it it wouldn\\'t be a first-person shooter if that were the case but no your character (garrett) is a thief equipped with a sword for close work and a bow for pretty much everything else since garrett\\'s hand-to-hand skills with the sword aren\\'t the greatest using ranged attacks with the bow is generally preferable and more in keeping with the theme of the game you can shoot someone or something with an arrow from the shadows (and get away with it) far more easily than you can try to hack at them with a sword and don\\'t forget to hide the bodies when you\\'re done as leaving them lying around will make it much more likely you get caught by anyone you\\'ve overlooked you\\'re also equipped with a blackjack for rendering guards unconscious which comes in quite handy when the need for silence is paramountsound unlike most fps games is one of the key elements of gameplay in \"thief\" sound can give your enemies away just as it can give you away to their ears sound can be used to distract and confuse your enemies as well different surfaces yield different sounds and changing your walking speed can dramatically effect the sounds you make walking on wood yields a hollow thump while walking on grass makes a gentle crunching noise walking on stone gives off a harsh clacking but walking on carpet is nearly silent walking on metal produces a resounding clang which can be heard for quite a ways the sounds you make become your enemies as much as the sounds your enemies make become your friends sound is an important tool in this game unlike any otherof course the visual aspect is important too and it\\'s just as key to gameplay as a thief often evading confrontation rather than inviting it your best bet is generally to stay in the shadows as much as possible letting guards and others pass while you remain unseen waiting a light meter at the bottom of the screen helps you know when you are visible to others and when you are not but the excellent lighting effects of the game provide plenty of clues as to which areas are safe and which are brightly lit when you need darkness in a lit area sometimes the only way to get it is to put some torches out for yourself  the graphics of \"thief\" are very good overall but the lighting effects are what really stand out in terms of excellence especially due to the fact that light is as critical a tool and sound bear in mind that the dark places in \"thief\" can hide an enemy just as effectively as it can hide you and sometimes they dowith its close attention to detail and its careful use of light and sound to enhance the experience \"thief\" is one of the most effectively immersive games i have ever played i am reminded of the first time i played \"doom\" or \"quake\" and i saw the first glimmerings of what the fps genre could do \"thief\" takes that concept and extends it much further forcibly making the player pay closer attention and thus get involved in the world of the game much more deeply than other games have ever required \"thief\" tasks the player to examine every shadow jump at every little sound and take chances on the best way through tight situations couple this involvement with a top quality storyline worthy in itself of a big-screen treatment and you\\'ve got a fantastic game -- which is exactly what \"thief\" is: fantastic\"thief\" made me re-learn everything i ever thought i knew about playing a first-person shooter my instinct to shoot first and deal with the consequences later fell quickly by the wayside as that is the surest road to ruin in \"thief\" this game taught me to rely much more on stealth than brute strength cunning more than a heavy arsenal and it made quite a difference in fact it made all the difference and it made \"thief\" a truly exceptional gaming

       " 'this normally takes a long time and is purely strategy-based  there are at least 50 different creatures you can fight with each with special abilities and statistics  you send &quot;heroes&quot; to bring these creatures around the map to gain resources experience artifacts and other treasures  then you use your cities to make more creatures  generally the idea is to wipe out your opponents in stunning turn-based battle sequences  the heroes are generally few and they often just explore and wipe out uncontrolled creatures which may flee attack you join you or offer themselves for hire  the games take a long time depending on the map at least 3 hours  you can make scenarios and the editor is pretty friendly  i recommend this game for people who want a slow-paced strategic challenge',\n",

I paid nearly 30 dollars when the game was new. I don\\'t like the idea that I have to keep paying to keep playing.I noticed no improvement in the physics or graphics compared to Dirt 2.I tossed it in the garbage and vowed never to buy another codemasters game. I\\'m really tired of arcade style rally/racing games anyway.I\\'ll continue to get my fix from Richard Burns Rally, and you should to. :)http://www.amazon.com/Richard-Burns-Rally-PC/dp/B000C97156/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1341886844&sr;=8-1&keywords;=richard+burns+rallyThank you for reading my review!
